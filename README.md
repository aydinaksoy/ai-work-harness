# AI Work Harness

**A local-first harness that turns an AI coding assistant into a disciplined
colleague.** Rules live in one file, cheap agents do the bookkeeping, a bash
script catches misses, and git undoes mistakes. Born from a 40,000-credit
month of undisciplined frontier-model use; rebuilt so that never happens
again — to anyone. MIT licensed.

## What it does, plainly

You work on tickets with an AI assistant. The harness makes that work leave
**records** instead of vibes: every ticket folder keeps its own log, current
state, and captured knowledge; every ad-hoc check — SQL, Python, whatever your
work is — lands in an audit-trail notebook; every file write auto-commits to a
local-only git repo; and a dumb bash validator refuses to let a session start on
top of an undocumented mess. Small
AI agents do the clerical work (logging, capturing, compacting) so the
expensive model — and you — only do the thinking. Nothing self-heals, nothing
phones home, and one markdown file is the law.

## Setup

Installing takes two steps: prove the machinery on your own machine, then lay
the estate down and wire your assistant.

**Every command, prerequisite and caveat lives in exactly one place —
[INSTALL-INSTRUCTIONS.md](estate/INSTALL-INSTRUCTIONS.md)**, which also carries
reconfiguration and the hook-activation caveat. This page repeats none of them
on purpose: two install documents drift apart, so every install command is told
once, there.

## Assumptions

This harness assumes — and only works as designed with — the following.
Anything marked *swappable* degrades gracefully if you differ.

### Who is working, and with what

- **A single operator working one active session at a time** — not concurrent
  multi-user access to a shared record repo. The auto-commit-per-write and
  single-writer git model assume one writer.
- **GitHub Copilot with custom agents + lifecycle hooks** (CLI and/or
  VS Code). Both features are preview-grade — verify config schemas against your
  version's docs (see **Setup**). Without Copilot the conventions and scripts
  still work — you just invoke agents' jobs by hand.
- **VS Code** as the editor (*swappable* — nothing hard-depends on it, but
  the notebook/interpreter flow is written for it).

### The toolchain it expects

- **git** installed; the harness creates a **local-only** repo at the
  workspace root (it must never get a remote — this public repo is the
  sanitised exception that proves the rule).
- **A Python environment whose interpreter can `import nbformat`** — that is
  the whole requirement. The notebook helper runs under whatever `python3` is
  on the path, and nothing in the machinery reads, requires or validates the
  environment's name. Create it yourself (the harness never creates one) and
  set it as the workspace default interpreter so notebooks pick up its kernel.
  The documentation's examples use Python 3.12 in a venv called `venv_global`
  — a convention worth keeping, not a requirement.
- **An issue tracker** — Jira assumed, any works (*swappable*). Replace the
  `PROJ` board key with yours; `ticket-init` degrades to template-with-TODOs
  when the tracker is unreachable.
- **Your real code lives under `GitHub/`** in the workspace (a folder of
  clones and a `.code-workspace`; *optional* — the harness gitignores it and
  never touches it, but the repo-mapping conventions assume it exists).

### Where the machinery runs

- **bash** (macOS/Linux; the scripts auto-detect GNU vs BSD userland, so
  stock macOS works without installing coreutils).
- **Windows:** the integrated **Git-Bash/Cygwin** bash runs the machinery (the
  #8 hooks-parse fix makes it viable); plain PowerShell can push the repo with
  git but cannot run the scripts.
- **WSL** is for an *ephemeral* Linux check only (clone inside `~`, never a
  `/mnt/c` mount) — never a standing home.

### How the Windows lane is verified (the one home for this fact)

By the maintainer, by hand — `run-demo.sh` ending in *ALL 6 DEMO STAGES PASSED*
in Git-Bash/Cygwin on real Windows hardware, which is the seat this harness is
developed on.

**No automated check touches Windows at all** — the `windows-latest` witness job
that used to re-run the demo informationally was removed (#281). The lanes that
gate a change are the Linux + macOS ones named under **Developing this harness
with an AI assistant**, below.

On your own Windows box the demo you run (**Setup**, step 1) is the proof; there
is no green badge standing in for it.

## The folder map

The annotated estate structure — every folder, what it is for, which part of the
machinery owns it, and the four states a `Tickets/` folder can be in — lives in
**[folder-map.md](estate/folder-map.md)**. It has its own document because it names
every shipped script, so the map grows every time the machinery grows; a front page
cannot carry that and stay a front page.

## The layers, bottom to top

### L1 — Git (local-only, rooted at `Work/`, whitelist-scoped)

The undo button. Every write auto-commits — via the Copilot `postToolUse` hook,
when it fires; harness-status warns if commits fall behind session activity.

One history covers the RECORDS: tickets (minus each `Logs/` and `Dump/`), the
constitution, `AGENTS.md`, and General AI-Knowledge — promoted knowledge never
leaves version control, and every other `Work/` folder never enters it. No
remote exists, nothing ever pushes.

### L2 — Hooks + `check-ticket-log.sh`

The dumb inspector. Runs at session START (the entry gate — it audits what the
previous session left behind; sessionEnd is a best-effort bonus), and checks
facts only: log appended? Current State exists? Index matches files? Fails
loudly, judges nothing.

### L3 — Filesystem

Single source of truth. `CONSTITUTION.md` holds every rule; each ticket folder
holds its own log, state, and knowledge; `General AI-Knowledge/` holds the
durable stuff; `AGENTS.md` is the entry contract Copilot loads on every
surface.

### L4 — The agents

The workers:

- `ticket-init` (smart, at pickup) — pulls Jira, interviews you (your
  words, non-negotiables, repos), suggests branch names, births the folder
- `ticket-recall` (cheap, at pickup) — read-only; narrates one ticket in
  fixed sections (Done / Changed / Unresolved / Suggested next), writes nothing
- `ticket-scribe` (cheap) — writes Session Log + Current State
- `check-scribe` (cheap) — records verified checks (any language) via the helper
- `doc-writer` (cheap) — drafts PR descriptions and READMEs
- `knowledge-keeper` (cheap) — captures learnings into `AI-Knowledge/`
- `knowledge-curator` (smart, rare) — compacts and promotes, with human
  approval; direct invocation only
- `weekly-digest` (cheap, at a boundary) — read-only; narrates a period
  (default 14 days) from the record — active tickets, knowledge, status
  deltas — writes nothing
- `harness-recall` (cheap, at pickup or on demand) — read-only; finds related
  tickets, knowledge and workflows through linked indexes, with scoped search
  for unindexed work; one cited hit per line; parent-callable, writes nothing
- `retrospective` (smart, at review time) — writes a period retrospective
  (default 12 months) FOR THE HUMAN in accomplishment register — one
  timestamped file to `General Human Knowledge/Retrospectives/`, nothing else

### L5 — You + a frontier model

The thinking. Everything below exists so this layer stays cheap, focused, and
honest.

## Find the useful record

Ticket summaries name the component, fields and logic changed. Current State is
short Now / Next / Blocked bullets; historical Session Logs stay unchanged.
See the constitution's *Record Writing* convention for writer defaults.

The constitution's [Context Discovery](estate/CONSTITUTION.md#context-discovery)
route points to reusable knowledge, repo workflows and the Work Map. Real
repo/pipeline pages link to tickets and existing notes, giving Obsidian a
navigable graph without a plugin. The shipped indexes are starting points,
not fictional work.

Ticket initialization uses the actual full template and a deterministic scaffold
helper; the agent still supplies the interview, facts and final validation.
Configured CLI/MCP tools are used for relevant live checks, with read-only
defaults and human authentication. The constitution owns these procedures.

## The maintenance port (offline, on demand)

Five human-run tools; each has a one-line purpose in the folder map, and its full
telling lives in `CONSTITUTION.md` (Part II) or the home named inline.

- `harness-status.sh` — estate-wide health report; every FAIL line ends with its fix.
- `tracker-sweep.sh` — board-vs-estate drift through a pluggable, tracker-agnostic
  fetch seam that fails open offline; the seam is documented in the script's header.
- `make-context-pack.sh` — scrubbed, disposable zip of the harness for external
  review; skim before it leaves the machine.
- `harness-housekeeping.sh` — `git gc`/repack to reclaim `.git` growth, all history kept.
- `harness-drill.sh` — rehearse recovery on a calm day: three read-only modes
  (`restore-drill`, `bundle-drill`, `undo-drill`); modes documented in the script's header.

## Capture — checks and records

**There is one door into a notebook, and a session record is written by hand.**

- **`_harness/scripts/append-notebook-cell.py`** — the single deterministic writer
  for `Checks/checks_master.ipynb`: one why-note + one **real, executable** code
  cell per verified check. The `check-scribe` agent appends the cell; you open the
  notebook and run it, and the notebook format binds the actual output to the cell
  that produced it. An executed cell is a stronger record than a transcription.
  Detail: the script's own commented header.
- **A session entry in a ticket `.md` you write yourself**, or ask the
  `ticket-scribe` agent to write. It is not a stamping job: an entry restates
  where the ticket now stands, which is judgement. `check-ticket-log.sh` then
  validates what was written and names the exact fix if it is wrong.

Three earlier tools sat here — a record appender, a shell-output transcriber and a
block-transport helper (#280). Nothing called any of them, and none had a job the
two routes above do not do better; they were removed rather than kept for symmetry.

## The one pattern, repeated everywhere

file states the rule → agent does the work → hook catches the miss →
git undoes the damage

And its corollary: **status observes, failures prescribe, nothing heals
itself.** A fixed record is always a human act.

## When it yells

**Red blocks, yellow schedules.** A `FAIL` at session start = fix before
working — apply the printed fix, or reconstruct the record from the Work
git history; never fabricate one. `WARN`/`NOTE` = keep working, handle the
chore at the next natural boundary. Machinery itself misbehaving =
`harness-status.sh` prescribes. Full state table: backbone, *Session
States — Operational Rules*.

## Developing this harness with an AI assistant

> **About the SOURCE repository, not your work estate.** This section is for
> people hacking on the harness itself (branches, PRs, CI). None of it is estate
> setup — the files it names (`CLAUDE.md`, `.github/`, `run-demo.sh`) live
> outside the `estate/` tree and never ship. To *install* the harness, see
> **Setup** above; nothing here points a user at dev machinery.

### The rules live in `CLAUDE.md`, not here

The harness is developed the way you'd use it: clone the repo and point an
agentic AI assistant at it. The repo root's **`CLAUDE.md`** — read automatically
by the assistant — holds the full development rules **and** the environment
setup: LF line endings (`core.autocrlf input` + the `.gitattributes` pins), the
demo dependencies, the Linux/macOS standing lanes, and WSL as an ephemeral check
only (never a `/mnt/c` home).

**The development loop is stated once, in `CLAUDE.md`, and this section does not
restate it** — which changes must run the demo, which classes of change are exempt,
and the regression guard a fix owes all live there, in one home, so the two
documents cannot drift apart. Read it before you change anything; don't hand-edit
the machinery from memory.

### Setting up the native-Windows lane

Install **Git for Windows** (or Cygwin) and **VS Code** with your agent
extension, and do all shell work in the integrated Git-Bash/Cygwin terminal —
plain PowerShell runs `git` but not the bash machinery.

Verify the host once, end to end:

```bash
bash dev/scripts/run-demo.sh   # must end with: ALL 6 DEMO STAGES PASSED
```

That hand-run is the whole of the Windows lane's verification, because no merge
gate covers Windows (**Assumptions**, above, is the one home for that fact).

### Merge gate

Work is issues-first — open or claim an issue, branch or fork, then open a PR
whose body closes it (`Fixes #NN`). **One workflow gates every merge**
(`.github/workflows/demo.yml`):

- **The acceptance demo on Linux *and* macOS** — required on both because the
  GNU/BSD split is real and the demo is the only thing that exercises it.
- **Four documentation detectors** — broken links, unbalanced code fences,
  carriage returns, dead pointers — which run as a step in the Linux lane on
  every pull request and fail it when one reds.

Four separate gates used to sit beside the demo: documentation, governance,
shell lint and a Windows witness. They were removed (#281) — a checking layer
built to make an implementer paranoid has no job once the findings come from
using the product; the four detectors worth keeping moved into the lane that
was already running.

Branch naming and issue anchoring are still the convention
(`NN-lowercase-kebab`), now kept by review rather than by a script.

### For an external design review

Take the scrubbed, disposable zip from `make-context-pack.sh` (the maintenance
port, above) to a design session, then let the acceptance demo prove the change
you bring back. The system was built that way.

## Document catalogue

The documentation surfaces this page does not already point at, each with its
one home. **Pointers only** — an entry points at where a thing lives; it never
restates the thing (the one-home law).

A document reached from **Setup**, **The folder map** or **Developing this
harness** above is not repeated here, and `folder-map.md` owns estate
*structure* while this owns document *navigation*.
