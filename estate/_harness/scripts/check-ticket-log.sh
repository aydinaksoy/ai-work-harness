# check-ticket-log.sh — entry-gate validator. Facts only, no AI.
# Output grammar: single-line OK: / WARN: / FAIL: / NOTE: records. Exit !=0 on any FAIL.
#
# SHAPE (#128): the per-ticket checks are FUNCTIONS that main()'s loop calls in the order they have
# always run. The code inside each is the code that used to sit inside that loop, MOVED rather than
# rewritten, so the records read exactly as they did. Two conventions keep that move faithful:
#   - the checks share GLOBAL variables (the moved code declares no `local`), which is how the loop
#     body already passed values along — $name, $md, $ok and $fails above all;
#   - each check ends with an explicit `return 0`. A trailing non-zero status that merely CONTINUED
#     inside the loop (the tail of an `&&` list, say) becomes, once the same code is a function,
#     that function's RETURN value — which `set -e` would treat as a reason to abort the run
#     mid-ticket. The explicit return keeps the old meaning; a failure that aborted before still
#     aborts, since `set -e` is just as live inside a function as it was in the loop.
# The `continue` statements stay in main()'s loop, where the loop they act on is visible.

# rewrites a file byte-identically, moving mtime while the content stands still. Judged on mtime
# that re-opened an already-validated ticket, RECENCY then failed it for having no log entry
# newer than its own stamp, and because a failing check never advances the stamp the ticket was
