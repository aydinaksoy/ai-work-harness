# ---- SCRUB TABLE — single source of scrubbing truth. Extend HERE when a new
# identifier class appears. sed -E 's|find|replace|gI' pairs.
# The trailing I makes every rule CASE-INSENSITIVE, which is not decoration: the self-audit below
# matches the same terms with grep -i, and until #169 these two disagreed. A lowercase placeholder
# then survived the case-sensitive scrub and tripped the case-insensitive audit — an ordinary prose
# edit failing the pack build. They are aligned by WIDENING the scrub, never by narrowing the audit:
# the audit exists as the backstop for the scrub, so a term the audit can see must be a term the
# scrub removes. Narrowing the audit to the scrub's blind spot would silence the alarm and let the
# identifier ship in a pack that goes outside the organisation. Over-scrubbing costs a re-read of a
# disposable export; under-auditing cannot be recalled. Case-insensitivity is also correct for what
# these rules match: an identifier is the same identifier in any case.
# Portability: the I flag on s/// is supported by both GNU sed and BSD/macOS sed.
