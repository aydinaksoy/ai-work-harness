# retro-stats.sh — the retrospective's DUMB counting pre-pass. It reads the record
# and the git history and emits plain counts; it makes NO judgement about impact or
# theme (that is the retrospective agent's job, ABOVE the arithmetic). It talks to
# NOTHING on the network and it ALWAYS exits 0 — a sparse or brand-new estate yields
# ZEROS, never an error, so the retrospective still runs on a thin estate (the
# fails-open family of #79/#81). The agent runs this, then folds the numbers INTO the
# human-facing document rather than leaving them beside it.
#
# Three counts, all derived from ticket grammar + git dates + record markers:
#   1. tickets by closing month  — each conforming, ticket-bearing folder bucketed by
#      the month of its LAST git commit (its concluding activity). The script does not
#      claim which tickets are truly done vs still in flight — that is judgement the
#      agent adds; here we only bucket by when work last landed.
#   2. checks captured           — replay-definition code cells across every ticket's Checks
#      notebook. This is record volume, not proof that cells were executed or evidence verified.
#   3. knowledge promoted        — tombstone lines in every AI-Knowledge/_index.md
#      (a promotion to General AI-Knowledge/ leaves a `promoted -> ...` tombstone).
#
# Window: --since / --until (YYYY-MM or YYYY-MM-DD) bound which closing-months count
# toward the ticket tally; unset means all-time. The retrospective agent passes its own
# 12-month default window here so the numbers match the prose.

# Deliberately NOT `set -e`: this script must survive every partial estate and still
# exit 0. We guard each step instead and finish with an explicit `exit 0`.
