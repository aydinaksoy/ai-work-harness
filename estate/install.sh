#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install.sh — scaffold or complete a harness Work ESTATE from this source distribution.
#
# It is a DUMB CREATOR (#39): it creates only what is ABSENT and NEVER edits, appends to,
# or repairs any file that already exists — even a broken one. Surfacing and fixing broken state
# is the validator's/status's/agent's job, on the record; the installer judges nothing and heals
# nothing. A second run finds nothing absent, so it creates nothing: the plan reports "PRODUCT
# files to create: 0" and each prerequisite already in place says so and is left untouched.
#
# THAT LAW TAKES EXACTLY ONE EXCEPTION, and it is opt-in: `--upgrade` (#134). The law used to be
# stated here as ABSOLUTE and no longer is, because the word became false the day this mode
# landed. The bound and the three classes of file the exception is drawn over are stated at
# UPGRADE MODE below. Two things about it belong at the top of this file, because a reader
# meeting the word "dumb creator" has to know them straight away:
#   * WITHOUT `--upgrade` NOTHING BELOW CHANGES. Every default run still creates only what is
#     absent. The exception is reachable only by asking for it by name.
#   * THE EXCEPTION IS A MOVE, NEVER A DELETE. A superseded or replaced file is moved into a
#     quarantine folder inside the estate and REPORTED at the moment it happens with the command
#     that puts it back; a RECORD is never touched at all. Nothing this installer touches, in
#     either mode, ever stops existing.
#
# It is the SHIPPING BOUNDARY (#43): it lays down PRODUCT files ONLY, DERIVED from the
# source tree by derive_product_paths below (#282). A fresh estate contains ZERO dev files.
#
# Runs FROM the source distribution (this file's directory), targeting an estate dir.
#   Usage: install.sh [--dry-run] [--yes] [--upgrade] [--rehearsal] [TARGET_DIR]
#     --dry-run  print the full plan and touch nothing — and ASK NOTHING (#302): a run that
#                creates no file can apply no answer, so no settings question is put
#     --yes      non-interactive: accept every suggested default
#     --upgrade  the ONE exception above: bring an EXISTING estate's machinery up to this
#                source's, retiring what this release supersedes. Records untouched, settings
#                carried forward, nothing deleted. Combine with --dry-run to see the plan first.
#     --rehearsal this run is PRACTICE, not somebody's install (#304). Every write the installer
#                would otherwise make OUTSIDE the estate — the agent deploy into the machine's
#                live assistant directory, and the validator's stamps — is confined to
#                TARGET/_rehearsal/ instead, so the run leaves nothing anywhere but its own
#                target. Say it whenever you are trying the installer out on a machine that also
#                uses the harness for real.
#     TARGET_DIR the estate root to create/complete (default: current directory — but the estate
#                must be SEPARATE from the source checkout, so in practice pass a target dir)
#
# SHAPE (#128): every step below is a FUNCTION that main() calls in order — roughly one function
# per thing the installer says out loud. The code inside each is the code that used to sit at the
# top level, MOVED rather than rewritten, which is what lets a run print exactly what it printed
# before. Two conventions keep that move faithful:
#   - the steps hand values to each other through GLOBAL variables (the moved code declares no
#     `local`), because that is precisely how the old top-level sequence passed them along;
#   - EXIT STATUS IS DELIBERATE (#261) — and this is a PROPERTY, not a checklist. NO FUNCTION IN
#     THIS FILE MAY HAND A BARE CALLER A STATUS IT DID NOT MEAN. "Bare" means a call that neither
#     tests the status nor guards it with `||`: a plain call under `set -e`, or an assignment from
#     a command substitution. It binds EVERY function here, not just the steps main() calls in
#     order — this convention was once written for the steps alone, and both defects this file has
#     actually had were HELPERS (detect_model, #200, which killed the run; detect_board, #233,
#     whose leaked status happened to measure zero), so the rule as written covered neither.
#     THE HAZARD is a tail whose status an UNSTATED BRANCH decided. A trailing non-zero that merely
#     CONTINUED at the top level (the tail of an `&&`/`||` list, say) becomes, once the same code
#     is a function, that function's RETURN value — which `set -e` treats as a reason to abort the
#     whole run, and which a command substitution turns into a fatal assignment.
#     THE MECHANISM, which is NOT the property: a function whose tail status would come from such
#     a branch ends with an explicit `return 0`, which says the zero rather than inheriting it.
#     Most functions here do. Three other shapes satisfy the property WITHOUT one and must not be
#     swept into it — the test is "did an unstated branch decide this status", never "is the word
#     `return` present":
#       * EMITTERS, whose tail IS the emission — detect_model, src_of, route_change.
#         The zero belongs to the emission itself; no branch chose it.
#       * DELIBERATE PROPAGATORS — sedi and was_created hand the caller the inner command's status
#         ON PURPOSE, which is the entire reason each exists.
#       * GUARDS THAT END IN `exit` — guard_target_is_source and guard_no_remote end in `exit 1`.
#         Those two are INSIDE this property, not an exception to it: `exit` hands no status to a
#         caller at all, it ends the run on purpose, and every non-exit path in both returns
#         explicitly. Stated out loud because the old wording ("each step ends with an explicit
#         `return 0`") was literally false of them, and an unstated exception is how the gap this
#         convention just closed got in.
#     WHAT THIS DOES NOT BUY, said plainly so nobody reads it as a general defence: it covers a
#     LEAKED status and nothing else. It is NO defence against a function that KILLS the run. Under
#     `set -euo pipefail` a bare failing command inside a function aborts AT that command, before
#     any tail statement runs, so the explicit `return 0` is never reached —
#     `f() { grep -q x /dev/null; return 0; }` called bare ends the script at the grep. That is a
#     different failure needing a different remedy, and this file does not claim to have one.

# ================================================================================================
# ---- UPGRADE MODE (#134) — the dumb-creator law's one exception --------------------------------
# ================================================================================================
# FOUR VERBS, and nothing else happens to an estate:
#   CREATE   an absent shipped file is copied in, exactly as the create path does.
#   REPLACE  a present PLAIN-MACHINERY file whose bytes differ from this source's is MOVED to
#            quarantine and this source's copy laid down in its place. The move is what keeps the
#            promise that nothing stops existing: a user who hand-edited a script gets their
#            version back from quarantine with the command printed in the run.
#   RETIRE   a path the shipped retire list names as superseded is MOVED to quarantine, with NO
#            replacement laid down at that path — that is how a rename stops leaving an estate
#            holding both names.
#   REPOINT  (#287) a KEPT file naming a path that a rename has superseded has that PATH — and
#            nothing else in the file — rewritten to the new one. This is the one verb that edits
#            a file in place rather than moving it, and it exists because the other three cannot
#            reach a carried-forward file at all: KEEP is what protects the user's settings, and
#            it protects the dead filenames sitting beside them just as thoroughly. Its bound is
#            narrow on purpose — a path token, never a line, never a sentence, never a whole file
#            — because the file it is editing may hold hand-edits nobody else knows about. Its
#            prior bytes go to quarantine first and every rewrite is reported as it happens.
# Anything that is neither — a record, or a file carrying the user's own settings — is KEPT and
# said out loud. A KEPT file is still eligible for REPOINT, and that is the only thing that ever
# happens to one. There is no fifth verb, and in particular there is no delete.
#
# A RECORD IS OUTSIDE ALL FOUR. Records are never created, replaced, retired or re-pointed —
# an upgraded estate's drawings, design notes and notebooks keep whatever names they were written
# with, and correcting those is a human act on the record, not something an installer does.

# upgrade_paths — the estate-relative shipped paths, from the SAME derivation the create path uses

# ---- CLASS 3 (parameterised machinery), DERIVED FROM THIS INSTALLER'S OWN STRUCTURE ------------
# NO CURATED LIST IS ALLOWED HERE, and the reason is the same one that removed the ship
# manifest: a list kept beside the installer drifts from it silently, and the drift is
# invisible exactly when it matters — at an upgrade. So the set is GENERATED, as a union of
# two halves, from the PARSED function bodies of
# this file (`declare -f`, which strips comments — so no comment and no closing-summary line can
# inject a member):
#   SUBSTITUTED  a body that runs this installer's one in-place substitution verb, `sedi`. The
#                file it edits carries a value the user chose, by construction.
#   DECLINED     a body that BOTH tests whether it created a file (`was_created`, or a NEED_*
#                flag) AND creates that file — its other arm is the declined-edit handler. The
#                "and creates" half is load-bearing rather than decoration: print_plan tests
#                NEED_HOOK too and merely NAMES the path — a line that merely names a file is not
#                that file's handler, and it is precisely the false member a path filter cannot
#                catch (#133).
# THE CANARY COMES FREE, and it is a PROPERTY of the query rather than a list of suspects: any
# installer-owned file that acquires a declined-edit handler is reported here on the very next run,
# with nobody assigned to remember. That is the moment such a file has become user-owned in fact
# (#133), and the query surfaces it whether or not anyone noticed writing the handler. The example
# this note used to give was the VERSION stamp; that file no longer exists (#298), and naming a
# deleted file as the standing illustration would teach a reader to look for something that is not
# there — the property is what was load-bearing, not the specimen.
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, said plainly: the OWNERSHIP test — who owns the per-estate value, which is
# what divides replaceable plain machinery from carried-forward parameterised machinery (#133) —
# is a human judgement and is NOT mechanised here. This returns CANDIDATES. Today every candidate
# is user-owned, so the candidate set and class 3 coincide; a future installer-owned candidate
# has to be ruled on by a person, and the generated list is what puts it in front of them.

# WHY IT IS NOT `sed s|old|new|g`. `setup.md` is a substring of `my-setup.md` and of `setup.mdx`,
# and a blind substitution would corrupt both — inside a file the user may have hand-edited, which
# is the worst place in the estate to be approximately right. So a match counts only when the
# characters either side of it are NOT name characters: the mention has to be the whole name, not
# part of a longer one. The boundary set is a STRING and the test is `index`, not a regex, because
# a bracket expression containing `/` is not portable across the awks this installer has to run on.
#

# ---- AI-ASSISTANT FINAL GATE (#39; OPERATOR-witnessed) -----------------------------------------
# THE RE-INSTALL NOTE (#302) is printed HERE because this is the line that sends a user to look for
# green, and on a machine that has installed a harness estate before, one thing is red. It is said
# out loud rather than left to be discovered: three seats met that red, could not account for it,
# and each concluded the machinery was broken.
# IT IS UNCONDITIONAL, and that is a decision rather than a shortcut. Printing it only when a stamp
# exists would need this file to carry the stamp directory's path, and that path has ONE home — the
# validator, which derives it from HARNESS_STATE_DIR. A second copy here would be free to drift
# from the first. The sentence carries its own condition instead, in the word IF.
# NOTHING AUTOMATED COULD HAVE FOUND THIS: the acceptance suite points HARNESS_STATE_DIR at a
# throwaway directory precisely so that running it never reads the machine's own stamps, so no run
# of it is ever in the state this note describes. It took installing the release on a used machine.
