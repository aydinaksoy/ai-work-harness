# AI Work Harness — Workspace Backbone

> **For AI agents:** Read this file at the start of every session. It explains who this workspace belongs to, how it is organised, and the conventions you must follow when logging work or creating ticket folders.
>
> **Context budget (STRICT):** By default, load only (1) **PART I** of this file and (2) the target ticket's header + **Current State** section. Do **not** read the full Session Log, the `AI-Knowledge/` contents, or `Logs/` unless the user explicitly asks for a deep dive or the Current State points you at a specific file. Context is metered — organise it, don't hoard it.
>
> **PART II routing (load only the section your task needs):** initialising a ticket → *Ticket Initialisation Procedure* · a FAIL/WARN at entry, or any operational question → *Session States* · building a review pack → *Context Pack Convention* · estate health → *Harness Status Convention* · craft work (writing SQL, a dbt model, a script) → *Skills Convention*.
>
> **Check retention (STRICT):** routine verification is ephemeral. Preserve only an observed result that passes the *Durable Evidence Gate* in the ticket's `Checks/checks_master.ipynb`; most searches, probes and validation runs never enter a notebook. See the gate under *Ticket Workflow*.

## Folder Structure (the `Work/` root — the directory containing this file)

```
Work/
├── Tickets/        Active and completed Jira ticket working folders
│   └── README.md   Thin pointer (the validator only validates recognised names; harness-status surfaces the rest)
├── GitHub/         Local checkouts of your code repos (primary dev work; never touched by the harness)
├── General AI-Knowledge/  Non-ticket knowledge base — tooling/setup/how-to docs (one subfolder per topic) — what the machinery READS
├── General Human Knowledge/  Human-facing OUTPUTS the machinery writes (e.g. Retrospectives/) — mirrors General AI-Knowledge the other way: what it WRITES for you (append-only, versioned)
├── _harness/scripts/   THE MACHINERY — validator, status, notebook helper, context pack, agent deploy (versioned: the enforcement layer has undo + history)
├── _agents/        SOURCE OF TRUTH for all .agent.md definitions (versioned; deployed to the user-level Copilot agent directory — live copies are derived and disposable; filesystem wins on drift). That directory is SHARED BY EVERY ESTATE ON THE MACHINE and is one of the few things the harness writes outside an estate: THE FIRST DEPLOY CLAIMS IT and records which estate it came from; EVERY LATER ONE MUST PROVE IT OWNS IT, so a deploy from a different estate REFUSES and names the two ways to say which run it is (`HARNESS_AGENT_DEPLOY_DIR` for a rehearsal, `HARNESS_AGENT_ADOPT=1` for a hand-off). Installing an estate meets no friction from this. A practice install declares itself with `install.sh --rehearsal` and writes nothing outside its own target.
├── <anything else>/  Your other folders — untracked by the whitelist, no conventions imposed
└── CONSTITUTION.md   ← this file
```

Ticket folders live **outside** the VS Code multi-repo workspace (`GitHub/<your>.code-workspace`), so nothing under `Tickets/` can be committed to a team repo by mistake.

`Work/` is the root of a **LOCAL-ONLY git repository**, scoped by a WHITELIST `.gitignore`: everything is untracked by default, and only the record set is re-included — `CONSTITUTION.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `_agents/`, `_harness/`, `Tickets/`, `General AI-Knowledge/`, and `General Human Knowledge/`. Within tickets, each `Logs/` and `Dump/` is ignored too (regenerable output and re-droppable inputs — working bulk, not records; the record is the ticket `.md`, `AI-Knowledge/`, and the `Checks/` notebook). Every other folder in `Work/` — `GitHub/` and any other folder you keep here — never enters history by construction, so new folders are automatically outside. One history for all records means promotion never exits version control and culling stale knowledge is safe. The repo versions records, not the warehouse. No remote ever exists; nothing ever pushes. For personal, uncommitted ignores beyond the shared whitelist, use `.git/info/exclude` (local-only, never shared or tracked).

`General Human Knowledge/` mirrors `General AI-Knowledge/` the other way round: GAK is what the machinery **reads**, GHK is what it **writes for you** — human-facing outputs (the first is `Retrospectives/`, written by the `retrospective` agent). Two rules govern it:

- **HISTORY IS APPEND-ONLY; REFERENCES ARE LIVING.** Dated deliverables, including `Retrospectives/`, are timestamped and never rewritten. A later retrospective is a new file. `Repo Workflows/` and discovery `_index.md` files are living references: correct them in place when their sources change, and note substantive runbook corrections in their index. New folders are append-only unless explicitly declared living here. Agents may read human-facing runbooks; the audience label is not an access restriction.
- **INSIDE THE WHITELIST.** These artifacts **are** record — a review deliverable is worth keeping and versioning — so the folder is re-included above and its contents are tracked and auto-committed like any other record, never treated as disposable scratch.

---

## Ticket Naming Convention

Nothing requires a specific ticket-folder name. Name folders however suits
your workflow — knowing that the names matching the recognised pattern are the
ones the validator checks, so a folder named anything else holds a record the
validator never looks at (state 2 below is how you find out). The tools
recognise a **recommended default pattern** out of the box but never force it
— naming is nudged, never enforced. By name and markers, a `Tickets/` folder
falls into one of four states (with one validation edge case noted after the
list):

1. **Matches the pattern + holds a ticket record → auto-validated.** A real,
   enforced ticket: the entry-gate validator checks its log and Current State
   every session.
2. **Hand-made, holds a ticket record, doesn't match → a heads-up (WARN).**
   `harness-status` surfaces it so you never mistake an unvalidated folder for
   a validated one: rename it to match, or — if it isn't really a ticket —
   `touch .not-a-ticket` to silence it. Never blocked.
3. **Pending (`.ticket-pending`) → a non-silenceable WARN.** When `ticket-init`
   creates a ticket but can't name it properly (tracker unreachable **and** no
   identity supplied), it gives the folder a deliberately non-conforming
   placeholder name and drops a `.ticket-pending` marker. Completing it takes
   **two steps**: rename the folder to a conforming name, **and** remove the
   `.ticket-pending` marker. `harness-status` nags every session until both are
   done — while the name is still non-conforming it says "rename to a conforming
   name to complete it"; once the name conforms but the marker lingers it
   switches to "remove it to finish: `rm .../.ticket-pending`". The **marker**,
   not the name, is the lifecycle token: a conforming rename alone never
   completes a pending ticket, so a real ticket can never be silently misfiled
   under a made-up conforming name. The pending WARN takes precedence over
   `.not-a-ticket`, so a real pending ticket can't be dismissed; only the
   recorded human act of removing the marker finishes it.
4. **No ticket content, or marked `.not-a-ticket` → silent.**

Nothing is ever blocked *for a naming choice* — the tools nudge with yellow,
never wall you off. (One edge case sits outside these four states: a recognised
name additionally commits the folder to validation, so a conforming folder that
is MISSING its `.md` record is a validator `FAIL` — fix by adding the record,
not by a naming nudge.) The two markers:

- `.not-a-ticket` — "this folder is **not** a ticket, leave it alone."
  Silences the state-2 heads-up. Your call; tracked in git, so silencing is a
  recorded, versioned choice.
- `.ticket-pending` — "this **is** a real ticket, still awaiting completion."
  Non-silenceable; the folder is completed by renaming it to a conforming name
  **and** removing this marker (a recorded human act). A conforming rename
  alone does not finish it — the marker is the lifecycle token, so a real
  ticket can't slip through silently misfiled.

The **recommended default** pattern:

```
YYYYMM<seq>-<BOARD>-<num>
```

| Part      | Meaning                                                                            |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `YYYYMM`  | Year+month the ticket was picked up — exactly 6 digits (the only fixed-width part) |
| `<seq>`   | Chronological order within the month — one or more letters (A, B, … Z, AA, AB, …; unbounded, so a month is never capped) |
| `<BOARD>` | Your issue-tracker board key (set your own)                                        |
| `<num>`   | The tracker's ticket number — digits, any length                                  |

**Example:** the first ticket picked up in May 2026, ticket number
PROJ-65474 → `202605A-PROJ-65474`. A busy month past `Z` rolls to `AA`,
`AB`, … automatically. The scaffold helper calculates this from the local
machine month and existing names, not from the chat date or folder count.

### Using your own scheme — one editable home

The recognition pattern lives in exactly one place: the `TICKET_RE` line in
`_harness/scripts/ticket-grammar.sh`, sourced by both the validator and
`harness-status`, so editing that one line moves both tools together. Real
teams have board schemes the default can't anticipate; adapting is a one-line
change.

**Worked example — a hyphenated board key.** A team whose issue-tracker board
key contains a hyphen (e.g. `DATA-ENG`, so tickets read like
`202607A-DATA-ENG-42`) finds these **unrecognised by default**: the default
pattern expects a single board segment with no internal hyphen, so the extra
`-ENG` segment doesn't match. The right fix is **not** to mark them
`.not-a-ticket` (they ARE tickets) — it's to widen the board segment in
`ticket-grammar.sh` to allow hyphens: `[A-Z0-9]*` → `[A-Z0-9-]*`. One line,
and both tools now validate the team's real tickets. This is the canonical
reason the pattern is editable: the default stays hyphen-free on purpose —
for the common case it keeps names unambiguous and human-parseable — while
editability is the escape hatch for everyone whose board it can't anticipate.

---

## Ticket Workflow

### 1. Local ticket folder — initialised via the `ticket-init` agent
When picking up a new ticket, invoke **`ticket-init`** with the Jira link. Its 8-step procedure — also the manual fallback — lives in **PART II → Ticket Initialisation Procedure**.

The resulting folder:

```
Tickets/
└── 202605A-PROJ-65474/
    ├── 202605A-PROJ-65474.md    ← primary ticket log file (source of truth)
    ├── AI-Knowledge/           ← AI agent memory .md files for this ticket (indexed + compacted, see below)
    ├── Checks/                 ← selected durable evidence: checks_master.ipynb (+ scratch files / per-tool subfolders as YOUR stack needs)
    ├── Logs/                   ← long run logs (build/test/pipeline output) — dump here so grep can slice them
    └── Dump/                   ← user-dropped misc files for the AI to read (.csv, screenshots, .docx/.pptx/.eml)
```

Any supporting files (spreadsheets, exports, scripts, etc.) also live in this folder.

Each ticket folder has four standard subfolders:

- **`AI-Knowledge/`** — AI agent memory/knowledge `.md` files for this ticket (see *AI Memory Convention* below — including the **index + compaction** rules).
- **`Checks/`** — selected, reproducible evidence in ANY language your work needs (SQL, Python, shell, API probes). `checks_master.ipynb` is the default recorder — one markdown why-note + one code cell per durable claim, appended via `append-notebook-cell.py`, on the workspace default kernel (`venv_global` by convention — see *Python environment* below; register other kernels freely). Routine verification stays ephemeral; scratch files may hold temporary work. Add per-tool subfolders if your stack wants them — the harness imposes none.
- **`Logs/`** — long-running command output (e.g. build/test output, dbt runs, pipeline logs). **AI agents: always redirect long logs here** instead of printing them into chat, so they can be sliced with `grep`/`tail`/`awk` and don't overflow the session context window.
- **`Dump/`** — the "landfill" for user-generated misc files dropped in for the AI to read: `.csv` extracts, screenshots (`.png`/`.jpg`), `.docx`/`.pptx`/`.eml`. This is *user input for the AI*, distinct from checks you write (`Checks/`) and command output (`Logs/`). Large scratch or dropped inputs belong **here** (git-ignored), not in the tracked ticket root — `harness-status` WARNs (yellow, never blocks) if a ticket's tracked root grows past `HARNESS_TICKET_WARN_MB` (default 5), pointing you here. **No customer PII, credentials, or secrets ever land in `Dump/`** — if an extract contains PII it doesn't belong in this folder tree at all; work with it in the approved location and reference it by path/description instead.

### Durable Evidence Gate

The durable unit is a **claim or decision**, not a command. The parent agent that
observed the work applies this gate BEFORE invoking `check-scribe`; the scribe
records a qualified handoff and never investigates for something to retain. If a
gate answer is unknown, do not capture. Zero notebook additions is the expected
outcome of ordinary ticket work.

**All prerequisites must hold:**

1. The exact check ran and its result was observed in this session.
2. Source tests, CI, a PR check, a durable application log, or an existing notebook
   capsule do not already retain the result adequately.
3. The command and output are safe to retain: no credentials, tokens, PII,
   customer data, or transient authentication material.
4. A future reader could safely replay it, or it is explicitly scoped as a
   point-in-time observation that must not be replayed blindly.

**At least one durable-value condition must hold:** it directly proves an
acceptance criterion or release decision with no better durable evidence; it is
the minimal reproduction of a non-obvious defect likely to recur; it establishes a
baseline, contract, reconciliation or production observation likely to be compared
later; or it justifies an irreversible, regulated, high-risk or operational
decision.

**Never capture** navigation and discovery (`pwd`, `ls`, search, file reads, symbol
lookups); git inspection; environment activation; import/syntax/format checks;
iterative lint, compile, build or unit-test runs already owned by source tests or
CI; failed attempts superseded by the decisive result; or exploratory queries that
support no retained decision. Consolidate related commands into ONE capsule that
proves ONE claim.

An appended but unexecuted cell is a **captured replay definition**, not verified
evidence. It becomes **verified evidence** only after execution in the notebook and
saved output. Never imply that appending a cell proved the claim; until notebook
execution by the agent is demonstrated, the human runs it.

**Python environment (PREREQUISITE):** the harness requires **a Python environment whose interpreter can `import nbformat`** — that, and nothing else. `append-notebook-cell.py` runs under whatever `python3` is on the path and sets no kernel, so **no part of the machinery reads, requires or validates the environment's name**. It is created BY THE USER — the harness never creates it, it only depends on it. Set it as the **workspace default interpreter** (in `GitHub/<your>.code-workspace`), so new terminals under `Work/` auto-activate it and notebooks default to its kernel — every ticket picks it up automatically. It also backs the Data Wrangler extension (view/clean `.csv`/`.parquet`/`.xlsx`). Create a repo-specific venv only when a repo needs different pins.

**The name is a convention, not a requirement.** These documents call it **`venv_global`** (Python 3.12 with `nbformat` + your toolchain, e.g. dbt) and one shared name is worth keeping — it is what makes "the workspace default interpreter" mean the same thing in every ticket and every conversation with an assistant. Rename it if you have a reason to; nothing will notice.

### 2. Ticket markdown file (`YYYYMM<seq>-<BOARD>-<num>.md`)
This is the **source of truth** for everything done on the ticket. It restores AI agent context without blowing up the context window — via the **Current State** section, not the full history.

**Top-level structure (strict order):**
```markdown
# <BOARD>-<num> — <Short Ticket Description>

**Ticket:** <Jira URL>
**Local path:** Work/Tickets/YYYYMM<seq>-<BOARD>-<num>

Repos:
- Work/GitHub/<repo>

Branches:
- `<branch>` in `<repo>`

Pull Requests:
- [#NNN](<PR URL>) in `<repo>` — draft | in review

Context:
- <Links to matching repo/pipeline pages, runbook and directly related work>

---

## Current State
- Now: <component and current outcome>
- Next: <one concrete next action>
- Blocked: <blocker or none; essential gotcha/link if needed>

## Background
<Why this ticket exists, business context>

## Scope / What needs to be done
<Checklist or description of work>

## Changes Made
<Technical detail of what was changed and where>

---

## Session Log
```

Every ticket markdown file must include the **Repos**, **Branches**, and **Pull Requests** sections directly after the header, listing the repos worked in, the branches, and all active PRs (draft and in-review) with links, repo, and state. Keep them current as repos, branches, or PRs change.

---

## Current State Convention

**`## Current State` is the section AI agents read to rehydrate.** It is a living summary, normally three short bullets labelled **Now**, **Next**, and **Blocked**, reflecting *right now*. Aim for under 100 words; add only a load-bearing gotcha or pointer:

- Where the work stands (done / in flight / blocked, and on what).
- The immediate next step.
- Anything non-obvious an agent must know before touching the ticket (gotchas, decisions made, files that matter).
- Pointers into `AI-Knowledge/` or the Session Log **only when** deeper context is genuinely needed (e.g. "see `AI-Knowledge/field-mapping.md` before editing the staging model").

**AI agents: update Current State at the end of every ticket session, as part of the same step as the Session Log append.** Overwrite it — unlike the Session Log, it has no history; history lives in the log. If the user asks a question the Current State can't answer, *then* deep-dive the Session Log / AI-Knowledge and say you're doing so.

---

## Session Logging Convention

**Default: automatic for ticket work.** At the end of completed ticket work, append one outcome delta under **Session Log**, without waiting to be asked. Do not create a ticket merely to log a general tooling or navigation task. The user vetoes or amends; they may say "log this now" to force a checkpoint.

**Section header format (strict — do not deviate):**
```
## YYYYMMDDHHMMSS - [Short one line description of session update]
```

**The timestamp is LOCAL machine time** — the same clock as the shell command
`date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S`. Do not write UTC (unless the machine's timezone is UTC):
the validator interprets this header in the machine's local timezone, so a
header written in a different zone can be misread as stale and wrongly
red-block the next session.

**The newest entry goes at the BOTTOM** — the validator reads the last entry in
file order, not the highest timestamp, so a new block written at the top leaves
an older one last and red-blocks with *"changed but no new Session Log entry
since last validation"* on the session where you have just written one.

**Example:**
```markdown
## 20260611143000 - Added source-aware order deduplication

- `orders` pipeline: added `source_id`; changed the dedup key from `order_id` to (`order_id`, `source_id`).
- Verification: the two-source fixture retained both orders; the same-source duplicate was removed.
- Deployment: not run; awaiting review.
```

Logs are bullet points only — concise, factual, in past tense. Each new session appends a new block; older blocks are never edited. The header must strictly follow `## YYYYMMDDHHMMSS - [Short one line description of session update]` — no other format is accepted.

Appending a Session Log block and refreshing **Current State** (and the Repos/Branches/PRs sections if they changed) are **one atomic step** — never do one without the other.

### Record Writing

Write for someone asking "what changed?", not "what did the agent do?" Name the
pipeline, table, workflow or file first. List added/removed columns and explain
changed keys, filters, joins, mappings or timing as **old -> new** when known.
Do not invent a type, previous value, deployment or result. Investigation-only
work names the finding and says that no implementation changed.

| Surface | Keep | Leave elsewhere |
|---|---|---|
| Header | Repo/branch/PR addresses; relevant Context links | Narrative and command history |
| Current State | Now, next, blocker; essential gotcha | Completed chronology |
| Changes Made | Settled component-first change bullets | Session-by-session replay |
| Session Log | Normally 2-5 outcome bullets, about 100 words | Copied explanations, tool lists |
| AI-Knowledge | Finding, evidence link, use-when trigger, consequence | Facts already owned by code or a runbook |
| General indexes / Work Map | Links and one-line retrieval cues | Duplicated facts or histories |

Keep verification separate from implementation; name the check and observed
outcome, or say "not run". Link to CI, PRs and detailed evidence instead of copying
them. Prefer "added source_id" to "enhanced traceability" and a named test to
"validated end to end". These are writer defaults, not validator gates. Keep
necessary detail when a budget would hide an important distinction. Never rewrite
old Session Log entries just to apply the new style.

---

## AI Memory Convention

Create any new memory `.md` files under `Tickets/YYYYMM<seq>-<BOARD>-<num>/AI-Knowledge/`. If memory must be created in session/agent memory first (where the folder is not directly writable), copy those `.md` files into the ticket's `AI-Knowledge/` folder after creation. Each ticket's AI knowledge base lives in its own `AI-Knowledge/` subfolder so context survives across sessions.

### Durable Knowledge Gate

The parent agent invokes `knowledge-keeper` only with a NAMED candidate from the
current ticket task, never merely to prove that zero is correct; neither agent
searches for something to preserve. A candidate must pass all six tests:

1. **Non-obvious:** a competent future agent would not infer it quickly from code,
   tests, the ticket header, or normal tool output.
2. **Verified:** this session established it from a named authoritative source or a
   reproducible observation.
3. **Retrievable:** there is a credible trigger expressible as "read before doing X."
4. **Costly to rediscover:** losing it would force a fresh investigation or create
   material delivery, data, security, or operational risk.
5. **No better owner:** it is not already canonical in code comments, tests,
   project documentation, the tracker, a PR, retained checks, Current State, or
   General AI-Knowledge.
6. **One topic owner:** the index was checked and an existing note is updated
   whenever it already covers the topic.

Ticket-local knowledge need only stay useful after context loss on THIS ticket;
promotion keeps the stronger test: useful on a future unrelated ticket,
expressible without ticket references, and not already covered. A note is a
compact retrieval card — **Finding**, **Evidence** (a pointer), **Use when** (the
trigger) and **Consequence** — of roughly 150–400 words. Zero is expected; one
topic update is normal.

**Index + compaction rules (STRICT — this folder is not a landfill):**

- Maintain an **`AI-Knowledge/_index.md`** whose every line follows this canonical grammar — the SINGLE authoritative spec the validator and both knowledge agents anchor on:
    - **Entry line:** `- <file>.md — <what it covers> — <when to read it>`
    - **Tombstone line:** `- <file>.md (promoted -> General AI-Knowledge/<Topic>)`
    - **Comment line:** any line starting with `#` is INERT — not an entry.
    - **Placeholder:** any token wrapped in `< >` (e.g. `<file>`, `<Topic>`) is illustrative and INERT — never parsed as a real filename.
    - **Rule:** every entry begins with `- ` (dash-space); the filename is the FIRST token after `- `. Prose after the filename (the `—` descriptions) is NOT parsed for filenames.
- Agents read the index first and pull **only** the specific files the task needs; never bulk-read the folder.
- **Before creating a new file, check the index.** If a file on the topic exists, extend or rewrite it — do not create `topic-2.md` / `topic-final.md` variants.
- **Compact on close-out** (and whenever the folder exceeds ~10 files): merge overlapping files, delete anything superseded or restatable in one Current State sentence, and refresh the index. Knowledge worth keeping long-term beyond the ticket graduates to `General AI-Knowledge/`.
- Prefer updating **Current State** over writing a memory file. A memory file earns its place only when the content is too long or too specialised for the ticket log.

---

## General AI-Knowledge Convention

Work that is **not tied to a Jira ticket** — tool setup, local environment configuration, reusable how-tos — is documented under `General AI-Knowledge/`. Each distinct topic gets its own subfolder containing a single, self-contained, human-readable markdown file named after the topic.

```
General AI-Knowledge/
└── AWS CLI Setup/
    └── AWS CLI Setup.md
```

Conventions:
- **One subfolder per topic**; the folder name *is* the topic (e.g. `AWS CLI Setup`).
- The markdown file mirrors the folder name and should stand alone: what was done, why, the exact commands, and a worked **Example** section.
- **Never commit secrets** (access keys, tokens). Use placeholders and reference the discovery commands instead.

## Context Discovery

At pickup, before implementation, and when the target repo/pipeline changes:

1. Read the ticket header and Current State; check its `AI-Knowledge/_index.md`
   for a matching retrieval trigger. Open only the relevant note.
2. Check `General AI-Knowledge/_index.md` for reusable tooling, constraints and
   ways of working; check `General Human Knowledge/_index.md` for repo runbooks.
   Read the matching workflow before choosing build, branch, deployment or
   environment commands. Human-facing references are available to agents too.
3. Search `General AI-Knowledge/Work Map/_index.md` by exact repo/pipeline name
   and recorded aliases. Follow its entity page to at most three relevant tickets
   or notes. `harness-recall` can do this as a bounded read-only subtask.
4. If the map has no match, use a scoped search of ticket headers, Current States
   and knowledge indexes. State what was searched and what was not found; a
   missing map entry does not prove no related work exists.

Reuse observed findings with a link; recheck mutable runtime/deployment facts
using the source repo or service. Do not treat old ticket status as live evidence.
Do not repeat the scan every tool call or bulk-load Session Logs, notebooks,
Logs or Dump. Go deeper only when a specific source or the user asks for it.

### Linked Work Map

`General AI-Knowledge/Work Map/` is a living navigation aid, not a database or a
second knowledge store. `_index.md` links pages under `Repos/` and `Pipelines/`.
Each entity page holds its exact name, observed aliases, links to relevant
runbooks/knowledge, and ticket links with one-line context. These associations
mean "this ticket discusses this component", **not** data lineage or deployment.

The parent agent maintains affected links when work first establishes an entity
or relationship. Only create a page backed by a source; do not generate pages for
every noun. Use ordinary relative Markdown links (encode spaces), which work in
editors and Obsidian without a plugin. Verify link targets. Never use bare ticket
IDs as links when the actual filename has a month/sequence prefix.

Add useful entity/runbook links under the optional **Context** header in new or
actively updated tickets. Legacy records need not be rewritten: entity-page links
already connect them in the graph. Maintain the appropriate general root index
when adding/moving a topic or runbook; promotion also updates the existing ticket
index/tombstone. Keep one owner for the underlying fact. The map may be partial;
its index declares coverage, and discovery always has the fallback above.

**Maintenance duties.** Before handing off to `ticket-scribe`, the parent updates
the impacted repo/pipeline page and the map root for any new relationship, adds up
to three useful reverse links under Context, and updates the General AI-Knowledge
or Human Knowledge index when a note or runbook is created, moved or renamed.
Promotion tombstones must stay valid. After the links are closed out, run
`python3 _harness/scripts/check-work-map.py` once. It is a read-only, warning-only
observer (`--json` for counts and findings; `--strict` is opt-in and never wired
into a hook) of encoded relative links, file-index and promotion links, whether
each initialized ticket is reachable from a map entity page, and orphaned general
notes. It does not establish that a fact is true, lineage, or cloud state. Report
existing uninitialized tickets and references outside the estate; never force a
fake fix. The parent hands the scribe the known links and the checker outcome as
an ephemeral summary, not extra AI knowledge. The scribe validates the links it was
given and asks the parent to repair gaps rather than reporting a false completion.
`ticket-init` needs the new ticket's page entries linked before its final scribe
step; `knowledge-curator` repairs backlinks and root indexes after a rename or
promotion; `doc-writer` registers a new runbook in its index. See the
[Harness Guide](General%20Human%20Knowledge/Harness%20Guide.md).

## Tools and Authentication

Use available tools for task-relevant authoritative facts before asking the user
to paste output: AWS CLI (`aws`) for cloud state, GitHub CLI (`gh`) or available
GitHub MCP for issues/PRs/CI, Snowflake CLI (`snow`) for warehouse metadata or
approved checks, and configured Atlassian MCP capabilities for tracker/wiki
context. These are optional adapters, not harness dependencies. Check
availability and the indexed local setup/workflow note first; never assume a tool
or profile exists, and a configured tool is not an authenticated one. If
unavailable, state the limit and the next useful action.

- Resolve the configured profile/connection, account, region, role and UAT/PROD
  target from local setup notes and repo runbooks before a remote operation. Do
  not infer per-environment profiles, silently fall back to a default account, or
  switch environment to bypass denied access. Actual mappings belong in those
  local references, not public agent contracts.
- Default to scoped read-only operations. Request explicit approval before
  changing remote data, infrastructure or tracker state. Authentication is access,
  not permission to mutate. Do not run unrelated services on every task.
- For MFA, passkeys, SSO or key passphrases, leave the terminal/browser prompt
  visible and ask the human to complete it directly. Wait and resume the same
  operation after completion; do not repeatedly retry, abandon the check, or
  substitute an assumption. Never collect secrets through chat/question tools,
  echo them, save them, or wrap interactive commands in output filters.
- Use metadata or aggregate results where possible. Never copy credentials,
  customer data, private account identifiers or raw authentication output into
  tickets, knowledge, public issues or PRs. Report an unverified result honestly.

## Agent Routing

Choose an agent for its job, not to make the roster look busy. Supply the target,
question and relevant pointers; a delegated reader returns findings, not new work.

| Need | Agent | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Start a ticket, interview and scaffold | `ticket-init` | Direct interactive session |
| Resume one ticket | `ticket-recall` | Read-only; parent may delegate |
| Find related tickets or workflows | `harness-recall` | Read-only, bounded; parent may delegate |
| Record completed ticket changes | `ticket-scribe` | One factual outcome delta; never for non-ticket work |
| Capture knowledge | `knowledge-keeper` | Named candidate passing the Durable Knowledge Gate; default zero |
| Capture evidence | `check-scribe` | Parent-qualified observed result passing the Durable Evidence Gate; default zero |
| Consolidate/promote knowledge | `knowledge-curator` | User-directed maintenance; approval for promotion |
| Draft a PR/README | `doc-writer` | Draft only; publication is separately authorized |
| Summarize a period | `weekly-digest` | Ephemeral, read-only |
| Write a dated review deliverable | `retrospective` | User-requested, append-only |

**Automatic versus invoked.** Mechanical hooks fire without anyone asking:
`sessionStart` runs the ticket validator and, as a separate command, the
warning-only work-map observer; `postToolUse` auto-commits records while the hook
is active; `sessionEnd` is a best-effort validate-and-commit. Agent contracts are
instructions for the session that invokes them, not a scheduler or a guarantee.
Started by the human: `ticket-init`, `knowledge-curator`, `weekly-digest`,
`retrospective`; `ticket-recall` and `harness-recall` by the human or a parent;
`ticket-scribe` by the parent for a completed ticket task; `knowledge-keeper` and
`check-scribe` only for a qualified candidate; `doc-writer` on a requested PR or
runbook. Every agent may also be called by a human. Publishing a draft is
authorized by the parent; no agent pushes autonomously. Prose cannot guarantee
judgement, and the objective checkers' warnings do not block style.

**Model profile (optional, operator-chosen).** Routine agents (`check-scribe`,
`doc-writer`, `harness-recall`, `knowledge-keeper`, `ticket-recall`,
`ticket-scribe`, `weekly-digest`) suit `Claude Sonnet 5.5 (copilot)`;
`ticket-init`, `knowledge-curator` and `retrospective` suit `Claude Opus 5.5
(copilot)`. Public template pins stay installer-configurable; tiers are a
capability guide, not a price guarantee.

## GitHub Repos (Key ones)

All repos live under `Work/GitHub/` (relative to this workspace root). List YOUR key repos here so agents can map ticket components to code — for example:

- `<org>/<dbt-models-repo>` — analytics models
- `<org>/<etl-repo>` — pipeline code
- `<org>/<shared-modules-repo>` — shared libraries
- `<org>/<infra-repo>` — infrastructure config

# PART II — PROCEDURES & MAINTENANCE (load on demand)

---

## Ticket Initialisation Procedure (`ticket-init`, or manual fallback)

Invoked with the Jira link; every step below is also the by-hand fallback:

1. Pull the full Jira issue — summary, description, acceptance criteria, comments, and the epic/parent one level up. (If Jira is unreachable, fill Background/Scope with `TODO` markers from the interview instead of failing — a *content* fallback; naming is decided separately in step 3.)
2. Before creating anything, search for that exact tracker identity across existing ticket names, including earlier months. Resume an existing ticket; do not allocate a second folder. Present a short digest and ask the three kickoff questions: (a) the ticket **in the user's own words**, (b) **non-negotiables**, (c) repo(s). Reuse answers already provided; do not ask the user to repeat them.
3. Follow **Context Discovery** above: inspect matching workflow/knowledge indexes and related tickets before proposing work. Keep at most three directly relevant links and one-line reasons; report a bounded negative search honestly.
4. For each repo, suggest 2-3 branch names following its documented workflow (fallback `feature/PROJ-XXXXX_<short-slug>`). Record the user's choice only. The init agent never creates branches or edits code repos.
5. Locate the actual installed template (shipped default `Tickets/999912Z-PROJ-99999`, possibly customized). Run `bash _harness/scripts/init-ticket.sh --template <actual-path> --identity <BOARD-num>`; use `--dry-run` to inspect the proposed name first. The helper reads local machine time, considers all boards in that month, orders sequences by length then alphabetically, increments past Z, copies the full tree including dotfiles, and renames the primary markdown only. It refuses duplicate identities, unsafe paths and collisions. Do not reconstruct a subset or hand-edit notebooks. `--root <estate>` is available when explicitly targeting another estate.
6. If no identity can be determined, explicitly use `--pending` instead of `--identity`. The unfinished scaffold has a non-conforming name and `.ticket-pending`. Once identity is confirmed, put it in the record's first heading and preview with `--identity <BOARD-num> --resume <pending-path> --dry-run` alongside `--template`. This excludes only that confirmed pending folder from duplicate checks; it writes nothing. Complete the confirmed folder/primary-markdown rename using the returned name, fill the record, **remove the marker**, and record/validate the real completion. Never invent a conforming tracker identity. Copying a template is not a completed or validated ticket.
7. Fill the real header, Context links, Background and Scope. Background starts with **In my words:** plus at most five tracker-context bullets; Scope contains **Non-negotiables** and acceptance criteria once. Do not copy comment transcripts. Seed Now / Next / Blocked, retaining unknowns as TODOs. Preserve all copied scaffold files; add no invented evidence or learnings.
8. Link the new ticket from its repo/pipeline page entries (and the map root for a new entity). Then invoke `ticket-scribe` with the observed initialization actions, the known links and the local timestamp for one real init entry. Run `bash _harness/scripts/check-ticket-log.sh`; resolve any FAIL before calling initialization complete. Run `python3 _harness/scripts/check-work-map.py` once and report its findings. A copied template or successful helper exit is not validation. If blocked, report the unfinished path and actual problem; do not manufacture another log entry to make a red disappear. If blocked, report the unfinished path and actual problem; do not manufacture another log entry to make a red disappear.

## Session States — Operational Rules

The one rule: **red blocks, yellow schedules.** `FAIL` = fix before any new
work. `WARN`/`NOTE` = keep working; schedule the chore at the next natural
boundary. Never fabricate a record to silence the gate — a gap you cannot
reconstruct is logged honestly AS a gap. These rules bind agents and human
alike.

**S0 — Green.** Entry gate silent. Work normally; at the end of completed
ticket work the parent invokes `ticket-scribe`. Non-ticket work invokes neither
scribe nor keeper; keeper runs only for a named candidate.

**S1 — FAIL at entry.** This is about the *previous* session, not the
current one. Triage in two bins:
- *Mechanical* (index orphan/ghost, missing section): apply the printed fix
  — delegable to the session agent. A minute, done.
- *Substantive* (missing Session Log entry, stale Current State):
  reconstruct honestly — from memory via `ticket-scribe`, or from
  `git -C <Work root> log` / `diff` — the Work root is the directory containing this file — (the auto-commits
  captured every write even though the paperwork failed). Late-but-true
  beats fabricated. Truly unreconstructable? Log it as:
  `## <ts> - Session unrecorded; changes per commits <range>`.
Then re-run `check-ticket-log.sh` to confirm green, and start work.

**S2 — WARN/NOTE nags.** Never interrupt flow for these. Fat index → run
`knowledge-curator` at ticket close-out or end of day. Zero-capture note →
expected; ask only whether a named learning passed the Durable Knowledge Gate.
Stale General
AI-Knowledge → batch into a review pass.

**S3 — Resumed, compacted, or abandoned sessions.** Entry validation
re-fires on resume; there is no compaction hook, so on a compacted session it
is `AGENTS.md` (which Copilot loads on every surface) that re-points the agent
at the conventions. A chat left idle for days: prefer a fresh session — the
entry gate plus a clean context beats a stale 200k-token one.

**S4 — An agent wrote garbage.** Git is the undo: inspect the log, revert
the specific paths, re-run the agent or fix by hand. The same failure
three times = upstream bug (agent instructions, contract, or platform) —
stop hand-fixing and take a context pack to a design session.

**S5 — The machinery itself is broken** (hook silent, agent missing from
the picker, a script erroring): run `harness-status.sh` and follow its
prescriptions. Machinery failure never blocks ticket delivery — but every
session run with broken machinery ends with a MANUAL `ticket-scribe`
invocation, and the breakage gets fixed before it becomes normal.

## Context Pack Convention (harness maintenance)

When taking the harness itself for external review/design (outside sanctioned
tooling), never hand-assemble files. Run:

```
_harness/scripts/make-context-pack.sh [--ticket <TICKET-ID>]
```

It stages the harness state — `CONSTITUTION.md`, `README.md`,
`AGENTS.md`, all `.agent.md` files, the hooks config, `check-ticket-log.sh`,
and `General AI-Knowledge/AI Harness/` — applies the scrub table — which you seed with your identifier classes
(employee IDs and personal paths, org/tracker URLs, cloud account locators) —
and zips it with a datestamped name. With
`--ticket`, it additionally includes that ticket's `.md` and
`AI-Knowledge/_index.md` (scrubbed) — never notebooks, `Logs/`, or `Dump/`.

Output rules:
- The zip lands at `~/Desktop/harness-pack-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.zip` — OUTSIDE both
  repos, always. A pack is a derived view: disposable, regenerated on
  demand, deleted after upload, never stored anywhere inside the `Work/`
  repo (where auto-commit would archive it forever).
- Contents have a stable file SET and sorted ORDER, captured in a generated
  `MANIFEST.txt` inside (every included file, plus a self-audit line confirming
  zero scrub-table hits); OS junk is excluded at staging. The `.zip` itself is
  NOT byte-reproducible — it records per-run file mtimes (and the Python
  zipfile fallback differs again); what is stable is the file set and the MANIFEST.

Rules:
- The scrub table lives at the top of the script — extend it there whenever a
  new identifier class appears; the script is the single source of scrubbing
  truth.
- The script prints a final reminder to **manually skim the zip before it
  leaves the machine**. Automation reduces redaction errors; it does not
  replace the human check.
- Structure travels, payload never does: no query results, no data extracts,
  no repo code in a context pack, ever.

## Harness Status Convention (on-demand health check)

To see the health of the whole estate — not just the last session — run:

```
_harness/scripts/harness-status.sh
```

Deterministic, no AI, no credits. **It is side-effect-free and prints its report
to stdout; the only thing it keeps on disk is one *primary observation* — the day
each WARN was first seen, so a parked yellow can visibly age (#71).** Everything
status *derives* stays unstored: a derived view is regenerated, never kept, so it
can't drift. But the filesystem does not remember *when* a condition began, and
status is the only observer present at onset — that first-seen record is an
observation the tool must make, not a view it can recompute, so it is stored (once,
inside the estate whitelist — the aging record is itself part of the record). What
narrows is what status *stores*, never what it is *safe* to run: running status
still cannot corrupt an estate, because the write is atomic, fails open, and
mutates only when the WARN set changes. Want a snapshot of the
report? Redirect it yourself, deliberately.
It reports, with `OK` / `WARN` / `FAIL` prefixes:

- Per active ticket: last Session Log timestamp and `AI-Knowledge/` file count.
  (The fat-index and sessions-without-capture NAGs are the *validator*'s, not
  status; status does not report Current State age.)
- Naming: a `Tickets/` folder that holds a record but isn't recognised, or a
  pending ticket awaiting its name (the WARN sweep).
- Repo size past the threshold, and session activity newer than the last
  commit (auto-commit-lag) — both WARNs.
- `General AI-Knowledge/`: entries whose `Last reviewed:` date is older than
  the staleness threshold (default 90 days, tunable via
  `HARNESS_KNOWLEDGE_STALE_DAYS`), and entries carrying no `Last reviewed:`
  date at all — each names the knowledge-curator as the next act (#72).
- Liveness: last commit in the Work local git (auto-commit is alive),
  hooks config parses, every `.agent.md` file present and registered
  (agents can fail to load *silently* after Copilot updates).

Every `FAIL` line includes the exact command or edit that fixes it.

Principle (applies to all harness tooling): **status observes, failures
prescribe, nothing heals itself.** No auto-repair, no dashboards — a fixed
record must always be a human act, or the audit trail stops meaning anything.

## Repo Health / Housekeeping (human-run maintenance)

**The Work repo grows structurally, not accidentally.** Every file mutation
triggers an auto-write commit (the safety net), and `Checks/` notebooks are
tracked JSON that the notebook helper rewrites in full on each cell append —
which git delta-compresses poorly. So the `.git` directory grows with the
**number of commits and the churn of notebook revisions**, not with the live
working-tree size. Over months of heavy use this is real: expect `.git` to
become several times the working-tree size (already ~3× at only a couple dozen
commits). This is the cost of the safety net, and it is worth paying — but it
needs an occasional, deliberate tidy-up.

**The remedy — run it by hand, periodically:**

```
_harness/scripts/harness-housekeeping.sh
```

It reports `.git` size, working-tree size, their ratio, and the commit count;
runs `git gc` to collapse the thousands of loose per-write objects into
packfiles (the actual reclaim); and reports the largest tracked notebooks.
Run it monthly, or whenever `.git` feels large. It is **safe**: it repacks
storage and preserves *all* history and records — it deletes no ticket, no
log, no commit, and rewrites no history (`git gc` only drops
already-unreachable objects). Pass `--aggressive` for a full recompress
(slower, rarely worth it; plain `gc` already does the job).

You don't have to remember a schedule: **`harness-status.sh` will WARN when
`.git` grows past a threshold** (default 50 MiB) and prescribe the housekeeping
command right there — the same observe-and-prescribe nudge as the ticket WARNs,
yellow not red. Tune the threshold with the `HARNESS_GIT_WARN_MB` environment
variable.

**The notebook accumulator.** A heavily-checked ticket's
`Checks/checks_master.ipynb` is the other thing that grows, because every
appended cell re-commits the whole JSON file. If one gets large, you may strip
its saved **outputs** to shrink it — e.g.
`jupyter nbconvert --clear-output --inplace '<ticket>/Checks/checks_master.ipynb'`.
This is a **deliberate manual choice**, never automatic: stripping mutates a
record (it drops the saved cell outputs), so the housekeeping script only
*reports* notebook sizes and never edits them for you.

**Squares with the doctrine.** Housekeeping is a human act, never automatic —
consistent with *status observes, failures prescribe, nothing heals itself*.
No hook invokes the script; you do. It compacts *storage*; it never alters or
deletes the *content* of a record.

## Skills Convention (worker-tier craft modules)

Prescriptive craft guidance and tool knowledge for the worker tier live in a Skills tree at
`General AI-Knowledge/Skills/`, discovered **index-first**: an agent matches its task against
`Skills/_index.md` and reads only the matching `SKILL.md`, never crawling the tree. **The rules
live with the skills** — the convention text, the frozen module shape (WHEN TO USE / CRAFT GUIDANCE
/ NAMED TOOLS / Last reviewed), the tool-availability requirement, and the *tools advise, never
gate* law are all stated in `Skills/_index.md` and `Skills/SKILL-TEMPLATE.md`. This constitution
only points; read those two files for the convention itself. New skills are minted through
`knowledge-curator` on explicit user approval — the same promote-with-approval gate as General
AI-Knowledge.

## Porting to another AI assistant

The harness is coupled to GitHub Copilot at only three thin, isolated points —
the `_agents/*.agent.md` format, the `hooks.example.json` hook shape, and
`deploy-agents.sh`'s deploy target; everything else is assistant-agnostic.
Porting means translating those three — mechanical work, not redesign. There is
no adapter layer to select: the three points are edited in place.
