# AI Work Harness — Workspace Backbone

<!-- harness-upgrade: preserve-user-content -->

> **For AI agents:** Read this file at the start of every session. It explains who this workspace belongs to, how it is organised, and the conventions you must follow when logging work or creating ticket folders.
>
> **Context budget (STRICT):** By default, load only (1) **PART I** of this file and (2) the target ticket's header + **Current State** section. Do **not** read the full Session Log, the `AI-Knowledge/` contents, or `Logs/` unless the user explicitly asks for a deep dive or the Current State points you at a specific file. Context is metered — organise it, don't hoard it.
>
> **PART II routing (load only the section your task needs):** initialising a ticket → *Ticket Initialisation Procedure* · a FAIL/WARN at entry, or any operational question → *Session States* · building a review pack → *Context Pack Convention* · estate health → *Harness Status Convention* · craft work (writing SQL, a dbt model, a script) → *Skills Convention*.
>
> **Check retention (STRICT):** routine verification is ephemeral. Preserve only an observed result that passes the *Durable Evidence Gate* in the ticket's `Checks/checks_master.ipynb`; most searches, probes, and validation runs never enter the notebook. See the gate under §1.

## Folder Structure (the `Work/` root — the directory containing this file)

```
Work/
├── Tickets/        Active and completed Jira ticket working folders
│   └── README.md   Thin pointer (the validator only validates recognised names; harness-status surfaces the rest)
├── GitHub/         Local checkouts of your code repos (primary dev work; never touched by the harness)
├── General AI-Knowledge/  Non-ticket knowledge base — tooling/setup/how-to docs (one subfolder per topic) — what the machinery READS
├── General Human Knowledge/  Human-facing OUTPUTS the machinery writes (e.g. Retrospectives/) — mirrors General AI-Knowledge the other way: what it WRITES for you (append-only, versioned)
├── _harness/scripts/   THE MACHINERY — validator, status, notebook helper, context pack, agent deploy (versioned: the enforcement layer has undo + history)
├── _agents/        SOURCE OF TRUTH for all .agent.md definitions (versioned; deployed to the user-level Copilot agent directory — live copies are derived and disposable; filesystem wins on drift). That directory is SHARED BY EVERY ESTATE ON THE MACHINE and is one of the few things the harness writes outside an estate: THE FIRST DEPLOY CLAIMS IT and records which estate it came from; EVERY LATER ONE MUST PROVE IT OWNS IT, so a deploy from a different estate REFUSES and names the two ways to say which run it is (`HARNESS_AGENT_DEPLOY_DIR` for a rehearsal, `HARNESS_AGENT_ADOPT=1` for a hand-off). Installing an estate meets no friction from this. A practice install declares itself with `install.sh --rehearsal` and writes nothing outside its own target.
├── <anything else>/  Your other folders — untracked by the whitelist, no conventions imposed
└── CONSTITUTION.md   ← this file
```

Ticket folders live **outside** the VS Code multi-repo workspace (`GitHub/<your>.code-workspace`), so nothing under `Tickets/` can be committed to a team repo by mistake.

`Work/` is the root of a **LOCAL-ONLY git repository**, scoped by a WHITELIST `.gitignore`: everything is untracked by default, and only the record set is re-included — `CONSTITUTION.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `_agents/`, `_harness/`, `Tickets/`, `General AI-Knowledge/`, and `General Human Knowledge/`. Within tickets, each `Logs/` and `Dump/` is ignored too (regenerable output and re-droppable inputs — working bulk, not records; the record is the ticket `.md`, `AI-Knowledge/`, and the `Checks/` notebook). Every other folder in `Work/` — `GitHub/` and any other folder you keep here — never enters history by construction, so new folders are automatically outside. One history for all records means promotion never exits version control and culling stale knowledge is safe. The repo versions records, not the warehouse. No remote ever exists; nothing ever pushes. For personal, uncommitted ignores beyond the shared whitelist, use `.git/info/exclude` (local-only, never shared or tracked).

`General Human Knowledge/` mirrors `General AI-Knowledge/` the other way round: GAK is what the machinery **reads**, GHK is what it **writes for you** — human-facing outputs (the first is `Retrospectives/`, written by the `retrospective` agent). Two rules govern it:

- **APPEND-ONLY.** Files are timestamped on creation and **never edited** — the never-rewrite-the-record doctrine applied to human deliverables. A retrospective is a dated statement of what was true when it was written, not a living document; a later run writes a **new** file, it never rewrites an old one.
- **INSIDE THE WHITELIST.** These artifacts **are** record — a review deliverable is worth keeping and versioning — so the folder is re-included above and its contents are tracked and auto-committed like any other record, never treated as disposable scratch.

---

## Ticket Naming Convention

Nothing requires a specific ticket-folder name. Name folders however suits
your workflow — knowing that the names matching the recognised pattern are the
ones the validator checks, so a folder named anything else holds a record the
validator never looks at (state 2 below is how you find out). The tools
recognise a **recommended default pattern** out of the box but never force it
— naming is nudged, never enforced. By name and markers, a `Tickets/` folder
falls into one of four states (with one validation edge case noted after the
list):

1. **Matches the pattern + holds a ticket record → auto-validated.** A real,
   enforced ticket: the entry-gate validator checks its log and Current State
   every session.
2. **Hand-made, holds a ticket record, doesn't match → a heads-up (WARN).**
   `harness-status` surfaces it so you never mistake an unvalidated folder for
   a validated one: rename it to match, or — if it isn't really a ticket —
   `touch .not-a-ticket` to silence it. Never blocked.
3. **Pending (`.ticket-pending`) → a non-silenceable WARN.** When `ticket-init`
   creates a ticket but can't name it properly (tracker unreachable **and** no
   identity supplied), it gives the folder a deliberately non-conforming
   placeholder name and drops a `.ticket-pending` marker. Completing it takes
   **two steps**: rename the folder to a conforming name, **and** remove the
   `.ticket-pending` marker. `harness-status` nags every session until both are
   done — while the name is still non-conforming it says "rename to a conforming
   name to complete it"; once the name conforms but the marker lingers it
   switches to "remove it to finish: `rm .../.ticket-pending`". The **marker**,
   not the name, is the lifecycle token: a conforming rename alone never
   completes a pending ticket, so a real ticket can never be silently misfiled
   under a made-up conforming name. The pending WARN takes precedence over
   `.not-a-ticket`, so a real pending ticket can't be dismissed; only the
   recorded human act of removing the marker finishes it.
4. **No ticket content, or marked `.not-a-ticket` → silent.**

Nothing is ever blocked *for a naming choice* — the tools nudge with yellow,
never wall you off. (One edge case sits outside these four states: a recognised
name additionally commits the folder to validation, so a conforming folder that
is MISSING its `.md` record is a validator `FAIL` — fix by adding the record,
not by a naming nudge.) The two markers:

- `.not-a-ticket` — "this folder is **not** a ticket, leave it alone."
  Silences the state-2 heads-up. Your call; tracked in git, so silencing is a
  recorded, versioned choice.
- `.ticket-pending` — "this **is** a real ticket, still awaiting completion."
  Non-silenceable; the folder is completed by renaming it to a conforming name
  **and** removing this marker (a recorded human act). A conforming rename
  alone does not finish it — the marker is the lifecycle token, so a real
  ticket can't slip through silently misfiled.

The **recommended default** pattern:

```
YYYYMM<seq>-<BOARD>-<num>
```

| Part      | Meaning                                                                            |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `YYYYMM`  | Year+month the ticket was picked up — exactly 6 digits (the only fixed-width part) |
| `<seq>`   | Chronological order within the month — one or more letters (A, B, … Z, AA, AB, …; unbounded, so a month is never capped) |
| `<BOARD>` | Your issue-tracker board key (set your own)                                        |
| `<num>`   | The tracker's ticket number — digits, any length                                  |

**Example:** the first ticket picked up in May 2026, ticket number
PROJ-65474 → `202605A-PROJ-65474`. A busy month past `Z` rolls to `AA`,
`AB`, … — `ticket-init` asks you how to extend rather than guessing.

### Using your own scheme — one editable home

The recognition pattern lives in exactly one place: the `TICKET_RE` line in
`_harness/scripts/ticket-grammar.sh`, sourced by both the validator and
`harness-status`, so editing that one line moves both tools together. Real
teams have board schemes the default can't anticipate; adapting is a one-line
change.

**Worked example — a hyphenated board key.** A team whose issue-tracker board
key contains a hyphen (e.g. `DATA-ENG`, so tickets read like
`202607A-DATA-ENG-42`) finds these **unrecognised by default**: the default
pattern expects a single board segment with no internal hyphen, so the extra
`-ENG` segment doesn't match. The right fix is **not** to mark them
`.not-a-ticket` (they ARE tickets) — it's to widen the board segment in
`ticket-grammar.sh` to allow hyphens: `[A-Z0-9]*` → `[A-Z0-9-]*`. One line,
and both tools now validate the team's real tickets. This is the canonical
reason the pattern is editable: the default stays hyphen-free on purpose —
for the common case it keeps names unambiguous and human-parseable — while
editability is the escape hatch for everyone whose board it can't anticipate.

---

## Ticket Workflow

### 1. Local ticket folder — initialised via the `ticket-init` agent
When picking up a new ticket, invoke **`ticket-init`** with the Jira link. Its 8-step procedure — also the manual fallback — lives in **PART II → Ticket Initialisation Procedure**.

The resulting folder:

```
Tickets/
└── 202605A-PROJ-65474/
    ├── 202605A-PROJ-65474.md    ← primary ticket log file (source of truth)
    ├── AI-Knowledge/           ← AI agent memory .md files for this ticket (indexed + compacted, see below)
    ├── Checks/                 ← reproducible evidence: checks_master.ipynb (+ scratch files / per-tool subfolders as YOUR stack needs)
    ├── Logs/                   ← long run logs (build/test/pipeline output) — dump here so grep can slice them
    └── Dump/                   ← user-dropped misc files for the AI to read (.csv, screenshots, .docx/.pptx/.eml)
```

Any supporting files (spreadsheets, exports, scripts, etc.) also live in this folder.

Each ticket folder has four standard subfolders:

- **`AI-Knowledge/`** — AI agent memory/knowledge `.md` files for this ticket (see *AI Memory Convention* below — including the **index + compaction** rules).
- **`Checks/`** — selected, reproducible evidence in ANY language your work needs (SQL, Python, shell, API probes). `checks_master.ipynb` is the default recorder — one markdown why-note + one executable code cell per durable claim, appended via `append-notebook-cell.py`, on the workspace default kernel (`venv_global` by convention — see *Python environment* below; register other kernels freely). Routine verification stays ephemeral; scratch files may hold temporary work. Add per-tool subfolders if your stack wants them — the harness imposes none.
- **`Logs/`** — long-running command output (e.g. build/test output, dbt runs, pipeline logs). **AI agents: always redirect long logs here** instead of printing them into chat, so they can be sliced with `grep`/`tail`/`awk` and don't overflow the session context window.
- **`Dump/`** — the "landfill" for user-generated misc files dropped in for the AI to read: `.csv` extracts, screenshots (`.png`/`.jpg`), `.docx`/`.pptx`/`.eml`. This is *user input for the AI*, distinct from checks you write (`Checks/`) and command output (`Logs/`). Large scratch or dropped inputs belong **here** (git-ignored), not in the tracked ticket root — `harness-status` WARNs (yellow, never blocks) if a ticket's tracked root grows past `HARNESS_TICKET_WARN_MB` (default 5), pointing you here. **No customer PII, credentials, or secrets ever land in `Dump/`** — if an extract contains PII it doesn't belong in this folder tree at all; work with it in the approved location and reference it by path/description instead.

### Durable Evidence Gate

The durable unit is a **claim or decision**, not a command. The parent agent that
observed the work applies this gate BEFORE invoking `check-scribe`; the scribe
records a qualified handoff and never investigates for something to retain. If a
gate answer is unknown, do not capture. Zero notebook additions is the expected
outcome of ordinary ticket work.

**All prerequisites must hold:**

1. The exact check ran and its result was observed in this session.
2. Source tests, CI, a PR check, a durable application log, or an existing notebook
   capsule do not already retain the result adequately.
3. The command/query and output are safe to retain: no credentials, tokens, PII,
   customer data, or transient authentication material.
4. A future reader could safely replay it, or it is explicitly scoped as a
   point-in-time observation that must not be replayed blindly.

**At least one durable-value condition must hold:**

- It directly proves an acceptance criterion or release decision with no better
  durable evidence.
- It is the minimal reproduction of a non-obvious defect likely to recur.
- It establishes a baseline, contract, reconciliation, or production observation
  likely to be compared later.
- It justifies an irreversible, regulated, high-risk, or operational decision.

**Never capture** navigation and discovery (`pwd`, `ls`, search, file reads, symbol
lookups); git inspection; environment activation; import/syntax/format checks;
iterative lint, compile, build, or unit-test runs already owned by source tests or
CI; failed attempts superseded by the decisive result; or exploratory SQL that
supports no retained decision. Consolidate related commands into ONE capsule that
proves ONE claim.

An appended but unexecuted cell is a **captured replay definition**, not verified
evidence. It becomes **verified evidence** only after execution in the notebook and
saved output. Until the agent's VS Code notebook capability is explicitly proven,
the user performs that execution; never imply that append alone proved the claim.

**Python environment (PREREQUISITE):** the harness requires **a Python environment whose interpreter can `import nbformat`** — that, and nothing else. `append-notebook-cell.py` runs under whatever `python3` is on the path and sets no kernel, so **no part of the machinery reads, requires or validates the environment's name**. It is created BY THE USER — the harness never creates it, it only depends on it. Set it as the **workspace default interpreter** (in `GitHub/<your>.code-workspace`), so new terminals under `Work/` auto-activate it and notebooks default to its kernel — every ticket picks it up automatically. It also backs the Data Wrangler extension (view/clean `.csv`/`.parquet`/`.xlsx`). Create a repo-specific venv only when a repo needs different pins.

**The name is a convention, not a requirement.** These documents call it **`venv_global`** (Python 3.12 with `nbformat` + your toolchain, e.g. dbt) and one shared name is worth keeping — it is what makes "the workspace default interpreter" mean the same thing in every ticket and every conversation with an assistant. Rename it if you have a reason to; nothing will notice.

### 2. Ticket markdown file (`YYYYMM<seq>-<BOARD>-<num>.md`)
This is the **source of truth** for everything done on the ticket. It restores AI agent context without blowing up the context window — via the **Current State** section, not the full history.

**Top-level structure (strict order):**
```markdown
# <BOARD>-<num> — <Short Ticket Description>

**Ticket:** <Jira URL>
**Local path:** Work/Tickets/YYYYMM<seq>-<BOARD>-<num>

Repos:
- Work/GitHub/<repo>

Branches:
- `<branch>` in `<repo>`

Pull Requests:
- [#NNN](<PR URL>) in `<repo>` — draft | in review

---

## Current State
<3–8 sentences, always up to date — see convention below>

## Background
<Why this ticket exists, business context>

## Scope / What needs to be done
<Checklist or description of work>

## Changes Made
<Technical detail of what was changed and where>

---

## Session Log
```

Every ticket markdown file must include the **Repos**, **Branches**, and **Pull Requests** sections directly after the header, listing the repos worked in, the branches, and all active PRs (draft and in-review) with links, repo, and state. Keep them current as repos, branches, or PRs change.

---

## Current State Convention

**`## Current State` is the section AI agents read to rehydrate.** It is a living summary, 3–8 sentences, always reflecting *right now*:

- Where the work stands (done / in flight / blocked, and on what).
- The immediate next step.
- Anything non-obvious an agent must know before touching the ticket (gotchas, decisions made, files that matter).
- Pointers into `AI-Knowledge/` or the Session Log **only when** deeper context is genuinely needed (e.g. "see `AI-Knowledge/field-mapping.md` before editing the staging model").

**AI agents: update Current State at the end of every session, as part of the same step as the Session Log append.** Overwrite it — unlike the Session Log, it has no history; history lives in the log. If the user asks a question the Current State can't answer, *then* deep-dive the Session Log / AI-Knowledge and say you're doing so.

---

## Session Logging Convention

**Default: automatic.** At the end of every completed task or working session, the AI agent appends a chronological record of work actions to the ticket markdown file under **Session Log** — without waiting to be asked. The user vetoes or amends; they do not have to initiate. (The user may still say "log this now" mid-session to force a checkpoint.)

**Section header format (strict — do not deviate):**
```
## YYYYMMDDHHMMSS - [Short one line description of session update]
```

**The timestamp is LOCAL machine time** — the same clock as the shell command
`date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S`. Do not write UTC (unless the machine's timezone is UTC):
the validator interprets this header in the machine's local timezone, so a
header written in a different zone can be misread as stale and wrongly
red-block the next session.

**The newest entry goes at the BOTTOM** — the validator reads the last entry in
file order, not the highest timestamp, so a new block written at the top leaves
an older one last and red-blocks with *"changed but no new Session Log entry
since last validation"* on the session where you have just written one.

**Example:**
```markdown
## 20260611143000 - Threaded the new field through the staging SQL

- Reviewed existing dbt models in `<your dbt repo>`
- Added `dm_new_metric` CTE to `intm__staging_model.sql`
- Fixed sqlfluff violations (table qualifiers, capitalisation)
- Updated unit test YAML to include the new field mock input
- Opened PR `feature/PROJ-99999_example` for review
```

Logs are bullet points only — concise, factual, in past tense. Each new session appends a new block; older blocks are never edited. The header must strictly follow `## YYYYMMDDHHMMSS - [Short one line description of session update]` — no other format is accepted.

Appending a Session Log block and refreshing **Current State** (and the Repos/Branches/PRs sections if they changed) are **one atomic step** — never do one without the other.

### Record Ownership and Brevity

Every fact gets one durable owner; other surfaces point to it or summarize it in
one line. These are writer stop conditions and review targets, not validator
failures: load-bearing detail may exceed a target when omitting it would make the
record misleading.

| Surface | Sole job | Default budget | Excludes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Header | Current repo, branch, and PR addresses | Compact lists | Narrative, commit history, check details |
| Current State | Now, next, blocker/gotcha, essential pointers | 3–5 sentences; target 120 words | Completed chronology, command lists, copied evidence |
| Changes Made | Settled implementation summary by component | Update only on meaningful implementation change | Session-by-session narration |
| Session Log | Delta since the previous entry | 2–6 bullets; target 120 words | Full reasoning, repeated header state, exact check bodies |
| Checks | Selected evidence for a durable claim or decision | Default 0; normally at most 2 capsules per task | Iteration history, duplicate CI evidence |
| AI-Knowledge | Hidden fact costly to rediscover and likely to be retrieved | Default 0; normally at most 1 topic update per task | Session narrative, check results, facts obvious in code |
| Logs | Bulky temporary command output | As needed; git-ignored | Durable conclusions |
| Git, CI, PR, tracker | Canonical history already retained there | Link, do not copy | Duplicated transcripts in ticket files |

---

## AI Memory Convention

Create any new memory `.md` files under `Tickets/YYYYMM<seq>-<BOARD>-<num>/AI-Knowledge/`. If memory must be created in session/agent memory first (where the folder is not directly writable), copy those `.md` files into the ticket's `AI-Knowledge/` folder after creation. Each ticket's AI knowledge base lives in its own `AI-Knowledge/` subfolder so context survives across sessions.

### Durable Knowledge Gate

The parent agent invokes `knowledge-keeper` only with a NAMED candidate from the
current task. It does not invoke the keeper merely to prove that zero is correct,
and neither agent searches for something to preserve. Every candidate must pass all
six tests:

1. **Non-obvious:** a competent future agent would not infer it quickly from code,
  tests, the ticket header, or normal tool output.
2. **Verified:** this session established it from a named authoritative source or a
  reproducible observation.
3. **Retrievable:** there is a credible trigger expressible as "read before doing X."
4. **Costly to rediscover:** losing it would require a fresh investigation across
  source code, external documentation, or runtime evidence, or create material
  delivery, data, security, or operational risk.
5. **No better owner:** it is not already canonical in code comments, tests,
  project documentation, the tracker, a PR, Checks, Current State, or General
  AI-Knowledge.
6. **One topic owner:** the index was checked and an existing note will be updated
  whenever it already covers the topic.

Ticket-local knowledge need only remain useful after context loss on THIS ticket.
Promotion retains the stronger test: useful on a future unrelated ticket,
expressible with no ticket references, and not already covered.

A note is a compact retrieval card, not an essay: **Finding** (the durable fact),
**Evidence** (a pointer, not a transcript), **Use when** (the retrieval trigger),
and **Consequence** (what action or mistake it changes). Target 150–400 words and
compress before 500. Zero is expected; one topic update is normal; two independent
notes require the parent to state why they cannot share an owner.

**Index + compaction rules (STRICT — this folder is not a landfill):**

- Maintain an **`AI-Knowledge/_index.md`** whose every line follows this canonical grammar — the SINGLE authoritative spec the validator and both knowledge agents anchor on:
    - **Entry line:** `- <file>.md — <what it covers> — <when to read it>`
    - **Tombstone line:** `- <file>.md (promoted -> General AI-Knowledge/<Topic>)`
    - **Comment line:** any line starting with `#` is INERT — not an entry.
    - **Placeholder:** any token wrapped in `< >` (e.g. `<file>`, `<Topic>`) is illustrative and INERT — never parsed as a real filename.
    - **Rule:** every entry begins with `- ` (dash-space); the filename is the FIRST token after `- `. Prose after the filename (the `—` descriptions) is NOT parsed for filenames.
- Agents read the index first and pull **only** the specific files the task needs; never bulk-read the folder.
- **Before creating a new file, check the index.** If a file on the topic exists, extend or rewrite it — do not create `topic-2.md` / `topic-final.md` variants.
- **Compact on close-out** (and whenever the folder exceeds ~10 files): merge overlapping files, delete anything superseded or restatable in one Current State sentence, and refresh the index. Knowledge worth keeping long-term beyond the ticket graduates to `General AI-Knowledge/`.
- Prefer updating **Current State** over writing a memory file. A memory file earns its place only when the content is too long or too specialised for the ticket log.

---

## General AI-Knowledge Convention

Work that is **not tied to a Jira ticket** — tool setup, local environment configuration, reusable how-tos — is documented under `General AI-Knowledge/`. Each distinct topic gets its own subfolder containing a single, self-contained, human-readable markdown file named after the topic.

```
General AI-Knowledge/
└── AWS CLI Setup/
    └── AWS CLI Setup.md
```

Conventions:
- **One subfolder per topic**; the folder name *is* the topic (e.g. `AWS CLI Setup`).
- The markdown file mirrors the folder name and should stand alone: what was done, why, the exact commands, and a worked **Example** section.
- **Never commit secrets** (access keys, tokens). Use placeholders and reference the discovery commands instead.

---

## GitHub Repos (Key ones)

All repos live under `Work/GitHub/` (relative to this workspace root). List YOUR key repos here so agents can map ticket components to code — for example:

- `<org>/<dbt-models-repo>` — analytics models
- `<org>/<etl-repo>` — pipeline code
- `<org>/<shared-modules-repo>` — shared libraries
- `<org>/<infra-repo>` — infrastructure config

# PART II — PROCEDURES & MAINTENANCE (load on demand)

---

## Ticket Initialisation Procedure (`ticket-init`, or manual fallback)

Invoked with the Jira link; every step below is also the by-hand fallback:

1. Pull the full Jira issue — summary, description, acceptance criteria, comments, and the epic/parent one level up. (If Jira is unreachable, fill Background/Scope with `TODO` markers from the interview instead of failing — a *content* fallback; naming is decided separately in step 3.)
2. Compute the ticket ID: scan `Tickets/` for this month's latest sequence and take the next one — order sequences by LENGTH first, then alphabetically (A < … < Z < AA < AB < …), so a multi-letter run sorts after the single letters (a plain string sort is wrong: "AA" sorts before "B"). On exhausting a run, ask the user how to extend rather than guessing.
3. Copy the `999912Z-PROJ-99999` template; fill the header (Jira URL, local path); then **name the folder and `.md` per two outcomes, never a silent misfile.** When you *can* determine the ticket's identity (tracker reachable, or the user supplied it), give it a **conforming** name matching the recommended pattern — an immediately-validated ticket; you conform on the user's behalf. When you *cannot* (tracker unreachable **and** no identity supplied), do **not** invent a fake-but-conforming name (it would validate silently as a misfiled stub); instead give the folder a deliberately non-conforming placeholder name (e.g. `pending-<timestamp>`) and drop a `.ticket-pending` marker inside it — a non-silenceable pending ticket that `harness-status` nags about until it is *completed*: renamed to a conforming name **and** the `.ticket-pending` marker removed (both steps — the marker, not the name, is what clears the nag, so a conforming rename alone can't leave a real ticket silently misfiled). The nag is the intended safety mechanism.
4. Present a short digest of the issue, then ask the user EXACTLY three things: (a) a paragraph explaining the ticket **in their own words**, (b) the **non-negotiables**, (c) the repo(s) involved.
5. Write **Background** — leading with the user's paragraph as an "**In my words:**" block, followed by at most five Jira-context bullets, never copied comments or parent narrative — and **Scope**, leading with a "**Non-negotiables**" checklist followed by the acceptance criteria once.
6. **Adjacency scan:** grep prior ticket titles and Current States plus the `General AI-Knowledge/` index for related work; keep at most three directly relevant pointers in Current State (e.g. "see 202605A-PROJ-65474, AI-Knowledge/field-mapping.md").
7. For each repo given, suggest 2–3 branch names in the `feature/PROJ-XXXXX_<short-slug>` convention; the user picks or edits; record the choice in **Branches**. The agent NEVER creates branches or touches `GitHub/` — recording only.
8. Seed a 3-sentence **Current State** (not started / next step / gotchas), create no Checks or AI-Knowledge during initialization, then invoke `ticket-scribe` for the init Session Log entry.

## Session States — Operational Rules

The one rule: **red blocks, yellow schedules.** `FAIL` = fix before any new
work. `WARN`/`NOTE` = keep working; schedule the chore at the next natural
boundary. Never fabricate a record to silence the gate — a gap you cannot
reconstruct is logged honestly AS a gap. These rules bind agents and human
alike.

**S0 — Green.** Entry gate silent. Work normally; `ticket-scribe` runs once at
the end of completed ticket work. `knowledge-keeper` runs only for a named candidate
that passes the Durable Knowledge Gate; zero capture is expected.

**S1 — FAIL at entry.** This is about the *previous* session, not the
current one. Triage in two bins:
- *Mechanical* (index orphan/ghost, missing section): apply the printed fix
  — delegable to the session agent. A minute, done.
- *Substantive* (missing Session Log entry, stale Current State):
  reconstruct honestly — from memory via `ticket-scribe`, or from
  `git -C <Work root> log` / `diff` — the Work root is the directory containing this file — (the auto-commits
  captured every write even though the paperwork failed). Late-but-true
  beats fabricated. Truly unreconstructable? Log it as:
  `## <ts> - Session unrecorded; changes per commits <range>`.
Then re-run `check-ticket-log.sh` to confirm green, and start work.

**S2 — WARN/NOTE nags.** Never interrupt flow for these. Fat index → run
`knowledge-curator` at ticket close-out or end of day. Stale General
AI-Knowledge → batch into a review pass.

**S3 — Resumed, compacted, or abandoned sessions.** Entry validation
re-fires on resume; there is no compaction hook, so on a compacted session it
is `AGENTS.md` (which Copilot loads on every surface) that re-points the agent
at the conventions. A chat left idle for days: prefer a fresh session — the
entry gate plus a clean context beats a stale 200k-token one.

**S4 — An agent wrote garbage.** Git is the undo: inspect the log, revert
the specific paths, re-run the agent or fix by hand. The same failure
three times = upstream bug (agent instructions, contract, or platform) —
stop hand-fixing and take a context pack to a design session.

**S5 — The machinery itself is broken** (hook silent, agent missing from
the picker, a script erroring): run `harness-status.sh` and follow its
prescriptions. Machinery failure never blocks ticket delivery — but every
session run with broken machinery ends with a MANUAL `ticket-scribe`
invocation, and the breakage gets fixed before it becomes normal.

## Context Pack Convention (harness maintenance)

When taking the harness itself for external review/design (outside sanctioned
tooling), never hand-assemble files. Run:

```
_harness/scripts/make-context-pack.sh [--ticket <TICKET-ID>]
```

It stages the harness state — `CONSTITUTION.md`, `README.md`,
`AGENTS.md`, all `.agent.md` files, the hooks config, `check-ticket-log.sh`,
and `General AI-Knowledge/AI Harness/` — applies the scrub table — which you seed with your identifier classes
(employee IDs and personal paths, org/tracker URLs, cloud account locators) —
and zips it with a datestamped name. With
`--ticket`, it additionally includes that ticket's `.md` and
`AI-Knowledge/_index.md` (scrubbed) — never notebooks, `Logs/`, or `Dump/`.

Output rules:
- The zip lands at `~/Desktop/harness-pack-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.zip` — OUTSIDE both
  repos, always. A pack is a derived view: disposable, regenerated on
  demand, deleted after upload, never stored anywhere inside the `Work/`
  repo (where auto-commit would archive it forever).
- Contents have a stable file SET and sorted ORDER, captured in a generated
  `MANIFEST.txt` inside (every included file, plus a self-audit line confirming
  zero scrub-table hits); OS junk is excluded at staging. The `.zip` itself is
  NOT byte-reproducible — it records per-run file mtimes (and the Python
  zipfile fallback differs again); what is stable is the file set and the MANIFEST.

Rules:
- The scrub table lives at the top of the script — extend it there whenever a
  new identifier class appears; the script is the single source of scrubbing
  truth.
- The script prints a final reminder to **manually skim the zip before it
  leaves the machine**. Automation reduces redaction errors; it does not
  replace the human check.
- Structure travels, payload never does: no query results, no data extracts,
  no repo code in a context pack, ever.

## Harness Status Convention (on-demand health check)

To see the health of the whole estate — not just the last session — run:

```
_harness/scripts/harness-status.sh
```

Deterministic, no AI, no credits. **It is side-effect-free and prints its report
to stdout; the only thing it keeps on disk is one *primary observation* — the day
each WARN was first seen, so a parked yellow can visibly age (#71).** Everything
status *derives* stays unstored: a derived view is regenerated, never kept, so it
can't drift. But the filesystem does not remember *when* a condition began, and
status is the only observer present at onset — that first-seen record is an
observation the tool must make, not a view it can recompute, so it is stored (once,
inside the estate whitelist — the aging record is itself part of the record). What
narrows is what status *stores*, never what it is *safe* to run: running status
still cannot corrupt an estate, because the write is atomic, fails open, and
mutates only when the WARN set changes. Want a snapshot of the
report? Redirect it yourself, deliberately.
It reports, with `OK` / `WARN` / `FAIL` prefixes:

- Per active ticket: last Session Log timestamp and `AI-Knowledge/` file count.
  (The fat-index and sessions-without-capture NAGs are the *validator*'s, not
  status; status does not report Current State age.)
- Naming: a `Tickets/` folder that holds a record but isn't recognised, or a
  pending ticket awaiting its name (the WARN sweep).
- Repo size past the threshold, and session activity newer than the last
  commit (auto-commit-lag) — both WARNs.
- `General AI-Knowledge/`: entries whose `Last reviewed:` date is older than
  the staleness threshold (default 90 days, tunable via
  `HARNESS_KNOWLEDGE_STALE_DAYS`), and entries carrying no `Last reviewed:`
  date at all — each names the knowledge-curator as the next act (#72).
- Liveness: last commit in the Work local git (auto-commit is alive),
  hooks config parses, every `.agent.md` file present and registered
  (agents can fail to load *silently* after Copilot updates).

Every `FAIL` line includes the exact command or edit that fixes it.

Principle (applies to all harness tooling): **status observes, failures
prescribe, nothing heals itself.** No auto-repair, no dashboards — a fixed
record must always be a human act, or the audit trail stops meaning anything.

## Repo Health / Housekeeping (human-run maintenance)

**The Work repo grows structurally, not accidentally.** Every file mutation
triggers an auto-write commit (the safety net), and `Checks/` notebooks are
tracked JSON that the notebook helper rewrites in full on each cell append —
which git delta-compresses poorly. So the `.git` directory grows with the
**number of commits and the churn of notebook revisions**, not with the live
working-tree size. Over months of heavy use this is real: expect `.git` to
become several times the working-tree size (already ~3× at only a couple dozen
commits). This is the cost of the safety net, and it is worth paying — but it
needs an occasional, deliberate tidy-up.

**The remedy — run it by hand, periodically:**

```
_harness/scripts/harness-housekeeping.sh
```

It reports `.git` size, working-tree size, their ratio, and the commit count;
runs `git gc` to collapse the thousands of loose per-write objects into
packfiles (the actual reclaim); and reports the largest tracked notebooks.
Run it monthly, or whenever `.git` feels large. It is **safe**: it repacks
storage and preserves *all* history and records — it deletes no ticket, no
log, no commit, and rewrites no history (`git gc` only drops
already-unreachable objects). Pass `--aggressive` for a full recompress
(slower, rarely worth it; plain `gc` already does the job).

You don't have to remember a schedule: **`harness-status.sh` will WARN when
`.git` grows past a threshold** (default 50 MiB) and prescribe the housekeeping
command right there — the same observe-and-prescribe nudge as the ticket WARNs,
yellow not red. Tune the threshold with the `HARNESS_GIT_WARN_MB` environment
variable.

**The notebook accumulator.** A heavily-checked ticket's
`Checks/checks_master.ipynb` is the other thing that grows, because every
appended cell re-commits the whole JSON file. If one gets large, you may strip
its saved **outputs** to shrink it — e.g.
`jupyter nbconvert --clear-output --inplace '<ticket>/Checks/checks_master.ipynb'`.
This is a **deliberate manual choice**, never automatic: stripping mutates a
record (it drops the saved cell outputs), so the housekeeping script only
*reports* notebook sizes and never edits them for you.

**Squares with the doctrine.** Housekeeping is a human act, never automatic —
consistent with *status observes, failures prescribe, nothing heals itself*.
No hook invokes the script; you do. It compacts *storage*; it never alters or
deletes the *content* of a record.

## Skills Convention (worker-tier craft modules)

Prescriptive craft guidance and tool knowledge for the worker tier live in a Skills tree at
`General AI-Knowledge/Skills/`, discovered **index-first**: an agent matches its task against
`Skills/_index.md` and reads only the matching `SKILL.md`, never crawling the tree. **The rules
live with the skills** — the convention text, the frozen module shape (WHEN TO USE / CRAFT GUIDANCE
/ NAMED TOOLS / Last reviewed), the tool-availability requirement, and the *tools advise, never
gate* law are all stated in `Skills/_index.md` and `Skills/SKILL-TEMPLATE.md`. This constitution
only points; read those two files for the convention itself. New skills are minted through
`knowledge-curator` on explicit user approval — the same promote-with-approval gate as General
AI-Knowledge.

## Porting to another AI assistant

The harness is coupled to GitHub Copilot at only three thin, isolated points —
the `_agents/*.agent.md` format, the `hooks.example.json` hook shape, and
`deploy-agents.sh`'s deploy target; everything else is assistant-agnostic.
Porting means translating those three — mechanical work, not redesign. There is
no adapter layer to select: the three points are edited in place.
