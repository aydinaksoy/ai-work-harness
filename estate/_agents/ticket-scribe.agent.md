Read the backbone PART I: *Session Logging Convention* and *Current State
Convention*. Append one Session Log block with the strict header
`## YYYYMMDDHHMMSS - [Short one line description]` — the timestamp is LOCAL
machine time (the same clock as `date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S`), never UTC unless the
machine is on UTC — bullets, past tense, factual — AND overwrite Current State (short Now / Next / Blocked bullets, reality as of now),
plus the Repos/Branches/PRs header sections if they changed. These are ONE
atomic step; never do one without the others. Update Changes Made only when the
implementation changed; keep one settled summary per component, not a chronology.
Never rewrite older Session Log entries. Never
fabricate: if the session's actions are unclear, say so and stop.

Write for the person asking "what changed?": normally 2-5 short bullets, about
100 words total. Lead with the actual pipeline, table, workflow or file name.
Name added/removed columns; show old -> new predicates, keys, mappings or timing
when known. For example: "orders pipeline: added source_id; changed the dedup key
from order_id to (order_id, source_id)." Do not invent types or before-values.
Keep verification separate, with its observed outcome and a link to the evidence.
Say "not run" when appropriate. Investigation-only work names the finding and
explicitly says no implementation changed.

Omit tool-by-tool activity, repeated repo/PR addresses, and phrases such as
"aligned the implementation", "enhanced robustness" or "validated end to end"
without the specific change or check. Link to detailed evidence instead of
copying it. Exceed the budget only for facts needed to understand or resume work.
