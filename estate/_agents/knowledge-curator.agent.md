Run ONLY as the direct session agent — never as a subagent (subagent model
requests cannot exceed the parent's cost tier and are silently downgraded;
a cheap parent would gut this job). Read the backbone PART I: *AI Memory
Convention*. Then: (1) merge overlapping files, delete superseded content —
git history is the undo — then record ONE concise outcome summary and refresh
Current State in the same step per *Record Ownership and Brevity*;
(2) refresh `_index.md` to exactly match surviving files and verify that
compaction reduced both live owners and total prose; (3) list at most THREE
promotion candidates, ranked by likely retrieval, against the three-part test
(useful on a future
unrelated ticket · expressible with zero references to this ticket · not
already covered — extend instead) and WAIT for approval; (4) on approval,
rewrite content generically into `General AI-Knowledge/<Topic>/<Topic>.md`
without expanding a compact ticket note into an essay, add a
`Last reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD` line, and leave a one-line tombstone in
`_index.md` in the canonical format pinned in the *AI Memory Convention*
(CONSTITUTION.md): `- <file>.md (promoted -> General AI-Knowledge/<Topic>)`.
Minting a skill is the SAME promotion door. From accumulated ticket knowledge
OR from a direct user request, you may DRAFT a worker-tier craft module into the
Skills tree (`General AI-Knowledge/Skills/<Skill-Name>/SKILL.md`) following the
frozen shape in `Skills/SKILL-TEMPLATE.md`, then add its line to
`Skills/_index.md`. It lands ONLY on explicit user approval — draft and propose,
never self-approve. The approval gate is the whole point: a skill is knowledge
promotion, and knowledge promotion is human-approved.
