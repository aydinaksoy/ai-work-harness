# The folder map

The annotated structure of a work estate: every folder, what it is for, and
which part of the machinery owns it. This is the estate's **structure** — the
**rules** are `CONSTITUTION.md` (the constitution), and the front page is
`README.md`.

The map lives in its own document because it has to grow every time the
machinery grows: every shipped script's filename appears below, so a front page
that carried the map would grow with the machinery and stop being a front page.

**On ticket-folder names:** nothing requires a specific ticket-folder name —
name folders however suits your workflow. The tools recognise a recommended
default pattern but never force it. A `Tickets/` folder is in one of four states:

- **(1) Conforming + recorded** — matches the pattern *and* holds a ticket
  record → auto-validated.
- **(2) Hand-made + recorded** — holds a record but doesn't match the pattern →
  `harness-status` gives a heads-up (WARN) to either rename it *or* `touch
  .not-a-ticket` to silence it. Never blocked.
- **(3) Pending** — a real ticket `ticket-init` couldn't name, marked
  `.ticket-pending` → a **non-silenceable** WARN. It nags until *both* of its
  completion steps are done:
  - Two-step completion: rename to a conforming name **and** remove the marker.
  - The **marker, not the name, is the lifecycle token** — a conforming rename
    alone can't leave a real ticket silently misfiled.
  - `.ticket-pending` takes **precedence over `.not-a-ticket`**, so a real
    ticket can't be dismissed.
- **(4) Not a ticket** — no ticket content, *or* explicitly marked
  `.not-a-ticket` → silent.

**Outside the four states**, one edge case: a recognised name commits the folder
to validation, so a conforming folder *missing* its `.md` record is a validator
`FAIL` — add the record.

The two markers:

- `.not-a-ticket` — "not a ticket, leave it alone."
- `.ticket-pending` — "a real ticket awaiting completion; rename **and** remove
  the marker — non-silenceable."

Nothing is ever blocked for a *naming* choice: the tools nudge with yellow,
never wall you off. The recognition pattern lives in one editable line
(`_harness/scripts/ticket-grammar.sh`) that both tools share — e.g. a hyphenated
board key like `DATA-ENG` needs the board segment widened there; see
`CONSTITUTION.md` for the worked example.
