# Agent contract — read before acting

1. The rulebook is `CONSTITUTION.md` at this workspace root. Read PART I
   before doing anything; pull PART II sections only when your task needs them.
2. Context budget: backbone PART I + the target ticket's header + Current
   State ONLY, unless pointed deeper. Never bulk-read Session Logs,
   AI-Knowledge folders, or Logs/.
3. At the end of every completed task, invoke `ticket-scribe` and
   `knowledge-keeper`. This is not optional.
4. Record every query worth keeping via `check-scribe` — never as throwaway
   one-offs.
5. Never persist durable knowledge into Copilot session or repo memory.
   Files in the ticket's `AI-Knowledge/` (indexed) are the only memory store.
6. On a FAIL from the validator: fix before new work. Red blocks, yellow
   schedules. Never fabricate a record.
7. Before craft work (writing SQL, a dbt model, a transform, a script), check
   `General AI-Knowledge/Skills/_index.md` for a matching module and read only
   that `SKILL.md` — index-first, never crawl the tree.
8. At ticket pickup or a change of repo/pipeline, follow PART I's *Context
   Discovery* route: ticket knowledge index, both general knowledge indexes,
   and the Work Map. Read only matching notes and workflows; use
   `harness-recall` for bounded adjacent-ticket research before implementation.
9. Use available CLI/MCP tools for task-relevant live facts. Follow PART I's
   *Tools and Authentication*: resolve the configured environment, default to
   read-only, and wait for the human to authenticate without collecting secrets.
10. Records name the component, columns and logic changed. Follow *Record
    Writing* and *Agent Routing*; do not narrate tool activity or invoke agents
    merely to increase their usage.
