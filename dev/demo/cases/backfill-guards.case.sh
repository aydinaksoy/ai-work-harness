# backfill-guards.case.sh — issue #18: retroactive guards for #1, #3 and #10, plus the #35
# here-string safety proof they depend on. SOURCED by the runner; see run-demo.sh.
#
# These three bugs were fixed and closed BEFORE the guard-per-bug law (#18) existed, so they
# shipped without guards. One guard each below, all witnessable on this host (no Mac needed), each
# provably red on the pre-fix behaviour.

# code_has / code_hasE — does the comment-stripped script text $code contain PATTERN?
# HERE-STRING, deliberately NOT `printf '%s' "$code" | grep -q`: under `set -o pipefail`
# grep -q's early exit on a match closes the pipe while printf is still writing, printf
# takes SIGPIPE, and pipefail turns that into a FALSE pipeline failure on a match (#35 —
# the exact class the #10 guard already avoids). A here-string has no pipe, so a match
# always reads as success. code_has = BRE (grep -q); code_hasE = ERE (grep -qE).

# [bsd-fallback] — the macOS/BSD portability contract. Static lexical check: every GNU-only command
# in the shell machinery must sit behind a BSD fallback, so nothing bare-GNU can regress in. HONEST
# LIMITATION: this is a commit-time lexical check, NOT a BSD runtime test (that needs BSD hardware
# — a deferred evidence box); it catches the #1 regression CLASS (GNU-only commands with no
# fallback) without a Mac. Comments are stripped first so a construct merely NAMED in prose doesn't
# count. Paired forms (stat -c/-f, date -d/-j) must co-occur per file (a GNU call implies its BSD
# twin); unpaired GNU-only forms (GNU in-place sed, find -printf, readlink -f, grep -P) must be
# absent.
#
# SCOPE, STATED: the scan is `estate/_harness/scripts/*.sh`. The suite's OWN sources under dev/demo/
# are outside that glob, and deliberately so — this very file necessarily holds the six token
# patterns as SEARCH LITERALS (they would self-match), and its sibling cases hold GNU/BSD probe
# pairs written for a different purpose. That is the same carve-out the pre-split suite had, where
# the one file holding those literals was skipped by name; splitting moved the literals out of
# estate/_harness/scripts/ entirely, so the skip is gone rather than relocated and the runner
# itself is
# now scanned like every other script in that directory. The demo files are covered instead by
# being RUN end to end, on both CI lanes, by the demo you are reading.

# [independent-clocks] — the dual-clock watermark. The stamp is two lines: line 1 = wall-clock
# (date +%s; recency = newest header >= last validation), line 2 = md mtime (freshness = did the
# file change since last validation). Different clocks, kept separate. This pins that freshness
# reads line 2 (mtime), independent of line 1 (wall): a change whose new mtime lands BETWEEN the
# stored mtime and the stored wall time is noticed only by a line-2 read. A single-line stamp (one
# value for both) would use the wall clock for freshness and MISS such a change — the exact #3 bug.
# (Distinct from the session-clock family, about the header's TIMEZONE; this is about the two stamp
# lines being separate values.) touch -t is POSIX (GNU+BSD).
#
# Mnemonics: mt1 = the anchored mtime (Jan 1), mt2 = the advanced mtime (Feb 1), wall1 = the
# wall-clock at validation ('now'). Ordering that matters: mt1 < mt2 < wall1.
#
# Case A — make a REAL change (content) and pin its mtime to Feb 1 (mt1 < mt2 < wall1), with NO new
# header. The change is above the stored mtime but below the wall clock, so only a line-2 (mtime)
# freshness read notices it.
# Two-clock → re-checks and FAILs "no new Session Log entry". Single-clock (line2=line1=wall1) →
# mt2 < wall1 → "unchanged" → silently skips (the bug).
# The vehicle is a content edit, not a bare touch: #309 made freshness judge CONTENT, so a
# mtime-only bump is now deliberately absorbed and can no longer stand in for a change. The
# invariant under test is untouched — that freshness reads the stamp's mtime line, not the wall
# clock — and pinning mtime after the edit is what keeps mt2 below wall1.
# Case B — complement: a genuine new header at/after the watermark AND mtime advances → both axes
# satisfied → validates OK.

# [wip-not-absorbed] — the suite's closing commit is gated behind DID_INIT so it fires ONLY when
# the demo created the repo. In a real clone (DID_INIT=0) it must do nothing, never sweeping a
# user's uncommitted work into a "demo: pass" commit. Exercises the ACTUAL gate (demo_close_commit
# — the same function demo_finish calls) against a throwaway repo that already has .git and a dirty
# tracked file. This is the reviewer's WIP-absorption probe made a standing guard.
#
# The load-bearing #10/P-i check: the dirty WIP must NOT be absorbed into any commit. Grep the
# WHOLE history for the WIP marker — a broken gate that commits the working tree leaves the marker
# in a commit, and this finds it. (The old guard only checked "no demo: pass commit", which ANY
# unconditional commit trips even with zero WIP present — that tautology was R-20; this asserts the
# WIP-specific property, and the revert-proof now flips because the WIP is ABSORBED, not merely
# because a commit exists.) Buffer the full history first, THEN grep it via a here-string — not
# `git log -p | grep -q`, whose early exit SIGPIPEs git and, under the demo's pipefail, fails the
# pipeline even ON a match, so the named WIP-absorption assertion silently never fires and the
# corroborating check fires instead.
