# The validator names a file ONLY by an index line's first token after "- "; prose, '#' comments
# and '<...>' placeholders are inert (grammar pinned in CONSTITUTION.md). These cases prove
# that in BOTH directions: honest records must PASS (no false ghosts, no false orphans — the R-12
# point) and real breakage must FAIL. A parser that scans whole prose lines flips the PASS cases
# to false FAILs — see the R-04 revert-proof.

#    BOTH decoys are REAL files, so release-extra.md is covered by its own entry and does not

#    unicode arrow must still be exempt from ghosting — else honest legacy records flip
