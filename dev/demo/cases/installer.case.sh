# installer.case.sh — #39 installer guards: the non-destructive / dumb-creator claims are the
# richest revert surface, so every one gets a case that reds if a run WOULD edit/clobber a
# pre-existing file or leak a DEV file. SOURCED by the runner; see dev/scripts/run-demo.sh.
#
# install.sh is exercised for real into a throwaway estate (agent deploy is sent to a throwaway dir
# so nothing touches $HOME). Plain-English asserts; guard-per-bug on each claim. I39_ROOT, I39_EST
# and I39_DEPLOY are file-scope: built once, read by every sub-case, removed at the end. I39_OUT is
# file-scope too, but REWRITTEN by every in_install call: it holds the LAST install's output, so a
# sub-case that wants it must read it straight after its own call.

  # THIS FILE DEPLOYS SEVERAL DIFFERENT THROWAWAY ESTATES INTO ONE THROWAWAY SINK, and since #304 a

  # Sharing the sink is deliberate — it is what makes these runs cheap — so the case DECLARES the
  # hand-offs once for the whole file rather than at eleven call sites. Exported, because the
  # sub-shells running install.sh must see it, and UNSET in case_installer's teardown: the #304
  # guard family runs later in this same shell and asserts the refusal, so leaving it set would

# running, what status the installer exited with, and the tail of what it said, then reds.
# WHY: under the runner's `set -e` a bare `bash estate/install.sh …` that fails kills the case AT
# THAT LINE, printing ZERO BYTES. Two seats hit that silence with different sabotages and neither
# got a message, because the case's own diagnostic for a failed install sits in a later sub-case
# the death never reaches. Seven of this file's eight expected-to-succeed invocations had no
# handler; one of those seven was doubly silent, dying inside a `pipefail` command substitution.
# A sabotaged installer must red with a SENTENCE, not in silence.
# IT MUST NOT SWALLOW THE FAILURE: it exits 1, so the run stays red — legibility, not tolerance.
# The interactive re-runs below that end in `|| true` are NOT routed through here: those are

#     prints is still a number the user finds and believes, and a summary line printing "unknown"

#     the discovery directory for their Copilot version.

# (b2) estate-root-tracked (#140): every ROOT-PINNED product file the installer lays down must be
#      TRACKABLE in the estate it lands in. This is the failure that ships silently and looks fine.
#      The shipped `.gitignore` denies everything at the root and re-admits named files, so the
#      estate's own documents are tracked only because a line names each one. Rename a document and
#      leave its line behind and the file is still on disk, the estate still reports healthy, and
#      the record has silently stopped covering it — including the constitution.
#
#      IT ASKS THE QUESTION STRUCTURALLY, so it never needs editing when a name changes. The subject
#      is derived: the product paths with no directory component, which is the same "root-pinned"
#      shape upgrade_is_machinery uses. `git check-ignore` is the only thing that can answer this —
#      a grep for the expected line would be a restatement of the whitelist, not a test of it, and
#      would pass on a line that git parses differently from the way the grep read it.
#
#      `--no-index` IS LOAD-BEARING AND THIS GUARD WAS WRITTEN WITHOUT IT FIRST. By default
#      check-ignore says nothing about a path that is already in the index, and the installer
#      commits the estate it creates — so every file this guard asks about is tracked by the time
#      it asks, and the first version returned "not ignored" for all twelve with the whitelist
#      deliberately broken underneath it. It reported ok twice on a sabotaged estate. `--no-index`
#      is git's own answer to exactly that question ("why did this path become tracked when the
#      rules say ignore"), and it is what makes the answer about the WHITELIST rather than about
#      what happens to be staged.
#

#      into an installed estate reds this guard by name on all three renamed documents.

# --- #134 UPGRADE MODE — the dumb-creator law's one exception -----------------------------------
# ================================================================================================
# SEVEN guards over ONE fixture, because the fixture is the expensive part of this family: a
# scratch SOURCE distribution built from this tree, an estate installed from it, that estate
# CUSTOMISED, and then the source moved on a version — a rename DECLARED in the shipped retire
# list, plus an upstream change to a plain machinery file.
#
# WHY THE CUSTOMISATION IS NOT DECORATION. A fresh estate holds the shipped defaults for
# everything, so an upgrade that silently reset somebody's board pattern, model pins and hook
# configuration would pass perfectly against one. Widening the grammar, moving a model pin off its
# placeholder and editing the hook config is what lets these guards fail in the way that matters.
#
# WHAT THEY DO NOT PROVE, stated here rather than left to be assumed: a scratch estate has no
# months of accumulated tickets, no dirty working tree, no long history and no hand-made folders.
# These guards prove the upgrade's LOGIC. They say nothing about a real installation.
#
# UP_SRC / UP_EST / UP_OUT are file-scope, built once by in_upgrade_fixture and read by every
# guard below; they live under $I39_ROOT so the case's existing teardown removes them.

# in_up_run — THE ONE WAY THESE GUARDS INVOKE THE SCRATCH INSTALLER when it is expected to
# SUCCEED. Same reason in_install exists above: under the runner's `set -e` a bare failing install
# kills the case AT THAT LINE and prints zero bytes, and a guard that dies silently is

# (x) upgrade-still-interviews (#302): THE BOUND ON THE FIX ABOVE, and the guard that catches that
#     fix going too far. An upgrade CAN create a file — machinery added since the estate was
#     installed — and an agent file it creates is pinned from the interview's own values:
#     apply_model_pins runs over CREATED on the upgrade path exactly as it does on the create path.
#     So the questions are justified on a real upgrade, and a change that suppressed them whenever
#     --upgrade was set would put an unpinned agent contract into somebody's live estate, which is
#     worse than the stall it would be fixing.
#     THE FIXTURE IS THE DEFECT'S OWN SHAPE: an agent file is DELETED from the upgraded estate, so
#     the next upgrade must CREATE it, and the estate's cheap-tier reference agent carries the pin
#     its user chose (UPCHEAP, planted in in_up_customise and asserted byte-unchanged above).
#     WHICH HALF CATCHES THE OVERREACH, said plainly because the two are not equal. THE QUESTION
#     COUNT is the tripwire: widening ask()'s test from DRY to "DRY or UPGRADE" makes this run ask
#     nothing, and that was WATCHED — three questions became zero. THE PIN ASSERTION DOES NOT RED ON
#     THAT VARIANT, and recording so is the point of writing it down: a silenced ask() still returns
#     the DETECTED default, so an established pin still lands. What such a variant really costs is
#     the estate whose pin CANNOT be detected — the placeholder is then applied with nobody told.
#     The pin half is kept because it is the claim the questions exist to serve, not because it is
#     what fails first.
#     STDIN IS AN ENTER-THROUGH, which is a real user accepting each offered default. --yes would
#     answer the questions from outside and prove nothing about whether they were asked at all.
