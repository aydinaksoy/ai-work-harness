# session-clock.case.sh — the validator's two stamp axes: the session-log header clock is LOCAL
# machine time, and freshness is judged on CONTENT. SOURCED by the runner; see
# dev/scripts/run-demo.sh for the contract.
#
# The validator reads a 14-digit header via epoch_from_ts14 (date -d/-j — LOCAL tz) and compares it
# to the watermark stamp_wall (date +%s — absolute epoch). Those two frames agree ONLY when the
# header is written in LOCAL time; a UTC header on a non-UTC machine is parsed hours behind and can
# land below the watermark, tripping a false "no new Session Log entry" FAIL that red-blocks honest
# work. That is the R-10 gap the now-named convention closes. This family pins BOTH directions: a
# local-now header is accepted, and a UTC header on a simulated non-UTC machine is (correctly)
# refused — proving the comparison IS clock-sensitive, so the convention MUST name the clock. It
# runs before the tour's abort-prone break-and-restore call, like the family above it. TZ is forced
# to a fixed non-UTC zone here and restored afterwards so it never leaks into the rest of the run.

# r10_validate — run the validator once for the two cases below, capturing BOTH halves of its
# answer: the MESSAGE into R10_OUT (the greps at each site read it) and the EXIT CODE into R10_RC,
# which is asserted HERE. $1 is what the calling site requires of that code — "clean" (0: an
# accepted header must not block) or "blocked" (non-zero: a refusal must actually red-block) — and
# $2 is the guard label for the BUG line. The exit-code half lives in ONE place so the two sites
# cannot drift apart on it; the message assertions stay at their sites because each names a
# different outcome. Neither half subsumes the other — the message says WHICH failure fired, the
# exit code says that it BLOCKED, and a validator that printed the right words while exiting the
# wrong way is exactly what this pairing catches (#161). set +e brackets the call so an expected
# non-zero rc cannot abort the demo before the assertions read it.
