# run-demo.sh — THE RUNNER of the acceptance suite (#143). It owns the shared estate the suite
# runs against, the ORDER the suite runs in, and nothing else. The suite itself is two other
# kinds of artifact, and the split is the point:
#   dev/demo/tour.sh          the STAGE-BASED TOUR — a demonstration a person watches. It
#                                  prints the six stage banners and performs the machinery a
#                                  newcomer came to see. It asserts nothing by name.
#   dev/demo/cases/*.case.sh  ONE CASE FILE PER GUARD FAMILY — the regression suite a
#                                  machine runs. Every named guard lives in exactly one of them.
# Those two serve different readers, which is why they are different files: a reader who wants to
# see the harness work reads the tour, and a reader who wants to know what is PROVEN reads the
# case file for that family. Keeping both in one artifact is what produced the file this split
# undoes.
#
# Proves the harness machinery works on THIS machine. No Copilot needed. Safe: uses temp state,
# creates+destroys one scratch ticket.
#
# NO RUNTIME IS STATED HERE, ON PURPOSE (#201). This line used to promise ~20s. Four figures have
# now been measured for the same suite on different hosts — 20, 32, 53 and 388 seconds — and none
# of them was right anywhere but where it was taken; a fifth measurement would produce a fifth
# figure and a fifth wrong comment. What a reader actually needs is the SHAPE, and the shape is
# stable: the first run on a machine is the slowest, and after that the time scales with the
# number of assertions the suite carries — which grows most batches. So that is what the front
# page and the install document say, and neither they nor this header quote a number.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE DOES NOT KNOW (#42 decoupling, cond 2): the documentation checks that once
# lived inside it MOVED OUT to dev/scripts/docs-check.sh, and the suite carries ZERO
# documentation knowledge — doc state can never red the product demo. That separation is
# unchanged; what changed in #281 is the other side of it. docs-check.sh became a standalone
# tool with four detectors, run as a STEP on the Linux leg of .github/workflows/demo.yml — the
# repository's only workflow, and the one THIS suite is the rest of. Between them they are the
# whole merge gate: if both are green, nothing else is standing behind them.
#
# HOW A UNIT IS NAMED AND FOUND: demo_order() below prints one unit per line as "<kind>:<name>".
# "tour:<name>" calls tour_<name> in tour.sh; "case:<name>" calls case_<name>, which is defined by
# cases/<name>.case.sh. Hyphens in a name become underscores in the function. NO CASE FILE CARRIES
# AN ORDINAL PREFIX: the order is data in demo_order(), not a property of a filename, so ordering
# the suite never mints the numbered-identifier class this split exists to delete.
set -euo pipefail

# --- setup: the shared estate every unit runs against ------------------------------------------
# Assign each temp dir on its OWN line, THEN export the names. `export VAR=$(cmd)` returns export's
# own status — always 0 — so under `set -euo pipefail` a failing mktemp would leave the variable
# EMPTY and the demo would run on with an unset state dir, mis-pointing every guard beneath it.
# Split apart, the assignment's status is the script's status: a failing mktemp aborts here,
# loudly, instead of producing a silently wrong run.
#
# HARNESS_WARN_STATE_DIR is ONE global override for status's first-seen record, exported ONCE here
# so it covers EVERY harness-status invocation in this suite and every future guard for free.
# Threading an override per call site would be the wrong shape: a single missed site in a later
# wave would silently write the real estate. Individual case files may still layer a case-LOCAL
# state path on top for determinism — the global export is the SAFETY floor under all of them.

# --- [case-completeness] — the guard a split suite cannot do without (#143 acceptance, part 3) --
# A SPLIT SUITE CAN SILENTLY RUN FEWER CASES THAN IT HAS. A case file that exists but is absent
# from demo_order() simply does not run: every remaining assertion passes, the runner reports
# success, and the suite is quietly smaller. Nothing else in this repository would notice — the
# baseline comparison catches it on the day of the split and never again, and the day someone adds
# a case file and forgets the list is months later.
#
# So the runner asserts that the set of case files it EXECUTED equals the set that EXISTS on disk,
# and names the difference in either direction. REVERT-PROOF: delete one line from demo_order()
# and this reds naming that case; add a case file without listing it and this reds naming it too.
#
# IT PRINTS NOTHING ON SUCCESS, on purpose. The suite's success lines are the acceptance evidence
# for this split and they had to stay byte-identical to the pre-split baseline, so a new ok-line
# here would have been the one difference in the comparison that proves nothing was lost. A silent
# assertion above a loud failure is an idiom this suite already uses ([one-pack-per-run] and the
# sed-portability case are the same shape); the failure is what has to be readable, and it is.
