# docs-check.sh — the documentation integrity check. FOUR DETECTORS, and they are the four that
# catch something a READER hits: a broken intra-repo link, an unclosed code fence, a carriage
# return in a document that ships LF-only, and a pointer to a file that no longer exists.
#
# IT USED TO CARRY TWENTY-ONE (#281). The other seventeen policed internal project doctrine —
# vocabulary rules, identifier grammar, one-home registries, decision-record shape, diagram
# currency notes — none of which a person outside this project ever reads, and all of which cost
# an implementer more attention than the defects they caught were worth. The four kept here are
# kept AS A SET: each guards a different way a document breaks for its reader, and none of them
# implies any of the others.
#
# DEV infrastructure: it never ships to a user estate, and no PRODUCT script references it. Pure
# greps, zero judgment, each detector's failure names its exact fix. The demo (dev/scripts/
# run-demo.sh) is what gates the product; this gates the prose. Two truths, two instruments.

# dc_fail — the one output shape a detector prints when it finds something, in ONE home. A message
# is passed as SEVERAL arguments and joined with a single space, which is what lets a long message
# be wrapped across source lines without changing a byte of what is printed. IFS is pinned to a
# space for the join because a caller may be inside a `while IFS= read` loop.
#
# IT COUNTS, IT DOES NOT SET A FLAG (#252). A detector decides whether it found anything by
# comparing $fail against the value it saved before starting; under a set-once flag every such
# comparison degenerates to 1-against-1 after the first failure anywhere in the run. The gate's
# verdict is unchanged: the exit test at the foot still reads 0 as "nothing failed".

# ================================================================================================
# THE SUBJECT ASSERTION (#269) — A DETECTOR EITHER READS WHAT IT CLAIMS TO READ, OR FAILS SAYING
# IT COULD NOT. A detector whose subject was absent used to conclude CLEAN, by three routes that
# all end in the same place: a grep over a path that is not there finds nothing; a loop over a list
# that could not be built runs zero times, so there is no iteration left to fail; and an error sent
# to /dev/null feeding an emptiness test makes "the tool broke" and "there was nothing" the same
# value. None of the three is distinguishable from a subject that is genuinely clean.
#
# All four surviving detectors scan the same set — every tracked *.md — so ONE helper makes the
# assertion for all of them. It still takes the caller's TAG: a red raised by a sibling that reads
# the same set is that sibling reporting, and each detector has to answer for its own blindness.
# dc_present — the SET form for a scan set built from the git index. A COUNT IN A MESSAGE IS NOT AN
# ASSERTION: the set can shrink to a fraction of itself and the success line simply prints the
# smaller number, which is how one ok-line here reported on three surfaces while naming the sixteen
# it used to read. Every path arriving on stdin must be a readable file. THE COUNT IS THE
# ASSERTION AND THE NAMES ARE ONLY A LEAD, so at most three are printed and the message says "first"
# rather than trailing an ellipsis — an ellipsis after the only missing path claims a truncation
# that did not happen, which is the same species of small untruth this whole item is about.
# Returns non-zero when anything was missing, so a caller may skip as well as report.
